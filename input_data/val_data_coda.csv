"PERSON 1: PERSON 2?!  What are you doing?
PERSON 2: Hold still, PERSON 1!"
"PERSON 1: Tell me, PERSON 2, what do you think of Raimondo?
PERSON 2: I would say he's pretty depraved.
PERSON 1: Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child."
"PERSON 1: The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
PERSON 2: Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, let go of the chair!
PERSON 2: What?"
"PERSON 1: Sounds good to me.
PERSON 2: Let's do it."
"PERSON 1: Did I say something?
PERSON 2: No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work."
"PERSON 1: Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
PERSON 2: Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
PERSON 1: Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
PERSON 2: One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this."
"PERSON 1: Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
PERSON 2: You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
PERSON 1: I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
PERSON 2: Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
PERSON 1: Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come."
"PERSON 1: He paid you man.
PERSON 2: You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
PERSON 1: Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God."
"PERSON 1: Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
PERSON 2: Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on."
"PERSON 1: Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
PERSON 2: Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon."
"PERSON 1: Where's the remote control I gave you?
PERSON 2: Why?
PERSON 1: Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
PERSON 2: No you're not.
PERSON 1: EXCUSE ME?
PERSON 2: I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
PERSON 1: JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!"
"PERSON 1: No, really.  What's she doing?
PERSON 2: Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
PERSON 1: Seriously."
"PERSON 1: Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, PERSON 2, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
PERSON 2: Fuck you.
PERSON 1: This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now."
"PERSON 1: Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
PERSON 2: You'll acquire a taste for it."
"PERSON 1: So, how was I?
PERSON 2: It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about."
"PERSON 1: I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
PERSON 2: He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's ""Vase with twelve Sunflowers"" is worth?"
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
PERSON 2: You and me both."
"PERSON 1: We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
PERSON 2: Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
PERSON 1: Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table."
"PERSON 1: No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
PERSON 2: What do we need another Shill for?
PERSON 1: Breasts."
"PERSON 1: I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.
PERSON 2: You sound like a hobo."
"PERSON 1: Wanna try it from the top?
PERSON 2: Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
PERSON 1: ... Who are you?
PERSON 2: Who do you think I am?"
"PERSON 1: Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
PERSON 2: No?
PERSON 1: She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
PERSON 2: Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
PERSON 1: Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
PERSON 2: No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way."
"PERSON 1: Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I""m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
PERSON 2: I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
PERSON 1: Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
PERSON 2: That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
PERSON 1: What do you mean?
PERSON 2: Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A ""wanna be,"" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me."
"PERSON 1: Sell maps?
PERSON 2: What of?
PERSON 1: The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
PERSON 2: Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2 Delgado, please?
PERSON 2: Allo?
PERSON 1: PERSON 2?  It's PERSON 1.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
PERSON 1: Yeah, I'm out.
PERSON 2: Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
PERSON 1: How are we doing?
PERSON 2: Perfect, PERSON 1.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
PERSON 1: Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
PERSON 2: Slow down, PERSON 1.  Slow down."
"PERSON 1: No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
PERSON 2: We will"
"PERSON 1: What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
PERSON 2: You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*."
"PERSON 1: Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
PERSON 2: How do we find him, PERSON 1?"
"PERSON 1: Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
PERSON 2: Fuck him - let him out!"
"PERSON 1: Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
PERSON 2: Well don't go forgetting your friends.
PERSON 1: Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
PERSON 2: You know it. Stay Black...
PERSON 1: Damn straight."
"PERSON 1: Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
PERSON 2: We didn't have sex.
PERSON 1: You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?
PERSON 2: Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
PERSON 1: You use the word ""fucking."" You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex."
"PERSON 1: I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain ""changes"" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by ""changes""?
PERSON 2: ""Changes.""
PERSON 1: ""Changes.""  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
PERSON 2: No. What?
PERSON 1: Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
PERSON 2: One of those ... big beds?"
"PERSON 1: Really?  PERSON 2-, that girl is sixteen.
PERSON 2: And a gymnast!
PERSON 1: She's sixteen years old, PERSON 2. That's totally and completely illegal."
"PERSON 1: Such as?
PERSON 2: Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
PERSON 1: The result would be ...
PERSON 2: Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
PERSON 1: Then what's stopping you?
PERSON 2: One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring."
"PERSON 1: They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
PERSON 2: That's when you take advantage."
"PERSON 1: I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
PERSON 2: Yes, I did.
PERSON 1: ... Well?
PERSON 2: Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. PERSON 1, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
PERSON 1: Well, Ben... I...
PERSON 2: I sympathize with your position, Mr. PERSON 1, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
PERSON 1: That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2!
PERSON 2: Bye-bye!"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: It gets clearer, the higher you hold it."
"PERSON 1: We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
PERSON 2: You said he was a deserter.
PERSON 1: That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
PERSON 2: You don't know that.
PERSON 1: You don't know he isn't."
"PERSON 1: You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
PERSON 2: ...yeah..."
"PERSON 1: Jeremiah?
PERSON 2: Yeah?"
"PERSON 1: Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
PERSON 2: Yes.
PERSON 1: Where?
PERSON 2: A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
PERSON 1: And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
PERSON 2: Three months.
PERSON 1: And what is your boyfriend's name?
PERSON 2: Chuck."
"PERSON 1: Why's that?
PERSON 2: He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
PERSON 1: What is?
PERSON 2: I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
PERSON 1: Swann?"
"PERSON 1: Dad!
PERSON 1'S DAD: It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip."
"PERSON 1: Here you go.
PERSON 2: Ow.
PERSON 1: Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something."
"PERSON 1: Give me the ball.
PERSON 2: My court, I go first."
"PERSON 1: Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
PERSON 2: I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
PERSON 1: When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, don't do this --
PERSON 2: It's time to put this person where he belongs.
PERSON 1: It's not necessary, PERSON 2.  Drew's going to step aside --"
"PERSON 1: You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
PERSON 2: Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
PERSON 1: They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
PERSON 2: I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
PERSON 1: Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
PERSON 2: Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you."
"PERSON 1: What did he want you to do?
PERSON 2: First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --"
"PERSON 1: Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
PERSON 2: Shut your hole, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
PERSON 2: Who wants me to stop?"
"PERSON 1: Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
PERSON 2: Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
PERSON 1: How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war."
"PERSON 1: Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
PERSON 2: Oh -- I almost forgot!"
"PERSON 1: Listen, PERSON 2 - I didn't believe that...
PERSON 2: It's good to see you, Holly."
"PERSON 1: You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
PERSON 2: You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
PERSON 1: Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God."
"PERSON 1: I like sleep.
PERSON 2: Here he comes."
"PERSON 1: Where'd you get this?
PERSON 2: I found it outside."
"PERSON 1: Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
PERSON 2: I'm just too old for going steady, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: So's he and he knows it."
"PERSON 1: This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
PERSON 2: Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
PERSON 1: Listen, ""Princess"", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --"
"PERSON 1: He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
PERSON 2: No problems on both counts."
"PERSON 1: What were you saying, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, PERSON 1. Just like you!"
"PERSON 1: My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
PERSON 2: You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
PERSON 1: There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
PERSON 2: Do you want to tell me what you found?
PERSON 1: Cash, stock certificates, and this..."
"PERSON 1: Hello.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, is that you?"
"PERSON 1: Who is who?
PERSON 2: A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa .."
"PERSON 1: Father, I'll do you right here.
PERSON 2: God have mercy on my soul."
"PERSON 1: That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, PERSON 2. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
PERSON 2: I guess so..."
"PERSON 1: Those are priceless sculptures.
PERSON 2: I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!"
"PERSON 1: I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
PERSON 2: Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?"
"PERSON 1: ...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
PERSON 2: -- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of."
"PERSON 1: You're not helping.
PERSON 2: Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us."
"PERSON 1: We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
PERSON 2: We believe?
PERSON 1: Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
PERSON 2: Lyle?!
PERSON 1: Yes sir.
PERSON 2: You're kidding me.
PERSON 1: No sir.
PERSON 2: Dean's with Lyle.
PERSON 1: And they have the video. That's confirmed.
PERSON 2: So they know everything.
PERSON 1: If they've looked at the video.
PERSON 2: Oh, let's assume that they have.
PERSON 1: If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
PERSON 2: Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, PERSON 1, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!"
"PERSON 1: You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
PERSON 2: I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir."
"PERSON 1: When could I look round?
PERSON 2: Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points..."
"PERSON 1: They're so precious when they're asleep.
PERSON 2: You really enjoy yourself, don't you?"
"PERSON 1: Ouch.
PERSON 2: Sorry."
"PERSON 1: I'd like to go, sir.
PERSON 2: No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid."
"PERSON 1: Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
PERSON 2: PERSON 1...?  What now?"
"PERSON 1: Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
PERSON 2: Thank god!"
"PERSON 1: Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
PERSON 2: David, come back here!"
"PERSON 1: Follow you where?
PERSON 2: Down to my car.
PERSON 1: Why?
PERSON 2: It's a surprise."
"PERSON 1: Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
PERSON 2: How do you know?
PERSON 1: Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so."
"PERSON 1: Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
PERSON 2: Yes, PERSON 1. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
PERSON 1: I'm just not ready."
"PERSON 1: His newspapers?
PERSON 2: Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks."
"PERSON 1: What was that about up there?
PERSON 2: What was what?
PERSON 1: What's with you?
PERSON 2: Nothing's with me."
"PERSON 1: Did you...
PERSON 2: Shhh."
"PERSON 1: What alibi?
PERSON 2: I can't tell you.
PERSON 1: You understand you're on trial for murder?
PERSON 2: I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
PERSON 1: Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood."
"PERSON 1: Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
PERSON 2: What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks."
"PERSON 1: Stay put!
PERSON 2: You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?"
"PERSON 1: Perhaps the ""Jam-in-ator"" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
PERSON 2: That's okay..."
"PERSON 1: Are you a doctor, too?
PERSON 2: Not yet.
PERSON 1: You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors."
"PERSON 1: Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
PERSON 2: I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
PERSON 1: What did your wife get her?
PERSON 2: We got the same thing."
"PERSON 1: What is this?
PERSON 2: I got ten marks for that."
"PERSON 1: Dea ex machina...
PERSON 2: What did you say?
PERSON 1: Our saviour..."
