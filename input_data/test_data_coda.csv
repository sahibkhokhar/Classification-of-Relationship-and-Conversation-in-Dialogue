"PERSON 1: PERSON 2!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
PERSON 2: Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
PERSON 1: Just go!
PERSON 2: Why is this?
PERSON 1: You're gonna shit your pants!
PERSON 2: Charming.
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
PERSON 2: First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!"
"PERSON 1: I read your teen beat manifesto.
PERSON 2: You did?
PERSON 1: I must say I found it rather appalling.
PERSON 2: That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
PERSON 1: Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
PERSON 2: I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
PERSON 1: Oh really?
PERSON 2: Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
PERSON 1: How do you know I've been with several women?
PERSON 2: A friend wrote me.
PERSON 1: Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
PERSON 2: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question."
"PERSON 1: My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
PERSON 2: Your pocket?
PERSON 1: The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
PERSON 2: Right."
"PERSON 1: Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
PERSON 2: You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco."
"PERSON 1: What's wrong with him?
PERSON 2: What do you think?
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
PERSON 2: He was the driver, PERSON 1. He did what he's supposed to do.
PERSON 1: I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
PERSON 2: Don't even say it, man."
"PERSON 1: I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
PERSON 2: Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
PERSON 1: Then who wrote the report?
PERSON 2: It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?"
"PERSON 1: That's enough of that kind of talk!
PERSON 2: I just said--
PERSON 1: I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place."
"PERSON 1: So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
PERSON 2: Superior numbers, kid!"
"PERSON 1: What?
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
PERSON 1: I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
PERSON 2: He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land."
"PERSON 1: What was that?
PERSON 2: What? I didn't hear anything.
PERSON 1: Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio."
"PERSON 1: Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
PERSON 2: Mm."
"PERSON 1: Everything okay?
PERSON 2: Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
PERSON 1: You didn't tell him about me?
PERSON 2: No."
"PERSON 1: What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
PERSON 2: I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
PERSON 1: Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
PERSON 2: He'll be there at 8:30.
PERSON 1: Tell me, PERSON 2 -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
PERSON 2: Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
PERSON 1: That's good, PERSON 2. I'm glad."
"PERSON 1: Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
PERSON 2: Cry-baby?
PERSON 1: That's what I said.
PERSON 2: My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
PERSON 1: Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
PERSON 2: For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
PERSON 1: Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
PERSON 2: They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
PERSON 1: Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
PERSON 2: She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
PERSON 1: I see. Was that all she said?
PERSON 2: We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
PERSON 1: You weren't going with her?
PERSON 2: No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
PERSON 1: Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
PERSON 2: Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
PERSON 1: Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
PERSON 2: Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
PERSON 1: That happens to be the truth.
PERSON 2: Who'd steal her body?
PERSON 1: That's what they're going to ask you."
"PERSON 1: Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
PERSON 2: You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
PERSON 1: Yes, sir.
PERSON 2: I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
PERSON 1: Naturally.
PERSON 2: Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
PERSON 1: I see.
PERSON 2: The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
PERSON 1: Don't mind what?
PERSON 2: You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
PERSON 1: Very clever.
PERSON 2: Now I'll have to borrow your key.
PERSON 1: Sorry, Mr. PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: What do you mean, sorry?
PERSON 1: You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
PERSON 2: I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
PERSON 1: Especially not Miss Kubelik.
PERSON 2: How's that again?
PERSON 1: No key!
PERSON 2: Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
PERSON 1: I dig.
PERSON 2: So what's it going to be?"
"PERSON 1: What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
PERSON 2: My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say."
"PERSON 1: You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
PERSON 2: Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
PERSON 1: Lisbon?
PERSON 2: In Portugal, yes."
"PERSON 1: Are you going to plead insanity?
PERSON 2: I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed."
"PERSON 1: The switch.  Hit the switch.
PERSON 2: Switch?  What fucking switch?"
"PERSON 1: What are you doing?
PERSON 2: Who am I?
PERSON 1: I don't know.
PERSON 2: That's right."
"PERSON 1: I carry bacon in my pocket.
PERSON 2: Oh, my gosh.
PERSON 1: Now we'll both call him.
PERSON 2: Come on, sweetheart...
PERSON 1: Yo, yo, yo..."
"PERSON 1: I need to know what you know about this guy.
PERSON 2: Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
PERSON 1: Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down."
"PERSON 1: The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
PERSON 2: That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood."
"PERSON 1: What're you doing?
PERSON 2: Going out."
"PERSON 1: What do you want, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Were you asleep?
PERSON 1: What do you want?
PERSON 2: 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
PERSON 1: Grouchy?
PERSON 2: ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
PERSON 1: What job?
PERSON 2: Were you asleep?
PERSON 1: What are you doing here?"
"PERSON 1: Yes, sir.
PERSON 2: She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes."
"PERSON 1: You need a doctor.
PERSON 2: Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish."
"PERSON 1: Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
PERSON 2: You said that once already... Too late now.
PERSON 1: Why?
PERSON 2: They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?"
"PERSON 1: It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
PERSON 2: That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
PERSON 1: Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
PERSON 2: What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life."
"PERSON 1: Warm.
PERSON 2: Is it?"
"PERSON 1: Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
PERSON 2: Where are you going?
PERSON 1: Out."
"PERSON 1: What did you tell that girl?
PERSON 2: I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
PERSON 1: Jesus...
PERSON 1: Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
PERSON 2: We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
PERSON 1: Look, I really appreciate your help, PERSON 2, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
PERSON 2: It's not hopeless...
PERSON 1: Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
PERSON 2: Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
PERSON 1: But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
PERSON 2: I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
PERSON 1: Hooray for me."
"PERSON 1: Dad?
PERSON 2: Delly?  In here."
"PERSON 1: What are you doing?
PERSON 2: Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall."
"PERSON 1: ...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
PERSON 2: Come away, Amy."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, give me the fucking gun!
PERSON 2: No, PERSON 1. It's not your gun. It's all of ours."
"PERSON 1: Catch you later!
PERSON 2: ...To be traveled through"
"PERSON 1: I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, PERSON 2.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
PERSON 2: Shit, that was fast.
PERSON 1: 12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
PERSON 2: I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
PERSON 1: Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
PERSON 2: Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow."
"PERSON 1: So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
PERSON 2: It's Webber.  PERSON 2 Webber.
PERSON 1: Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM."
"PERSON 1: If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
PERSON 2: I'd slap his face.
PERSON 1: I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any."
"PERSON 1: Cal, my wife PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Nice to meet you."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, what the hell is--
PERSON 1: Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.."
"PERSON 1: But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
PERSON 2: I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her."
"PERSON 1: I want them spitting blood!
PERSON 2: Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once PERSON 1 Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!"
"PERSON 1: Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
PERSON 2: Now?"
"PERSON 1: Howard Stern.
PERSON 2: Obviously."
"PERSON 1: Yes! That's it!
PERSON 2: I thought so!"
"PERSON 1: Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
PERSON 2: What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
PERSON 1: Stop it!"
"PERSON 1: We just thought...
PERSON 2: No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?"
"PERSON 1: Who?
PERSON 2: David Ferrie.
PERSON 1: No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
PERSON 2: ...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours..."
"PERSON 1: Listen PERSON 2, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
PERSON 1: Like the manual says, ""Information is..."
"PERSON 1: Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
PERSON 2: We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
PERSON 1: The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket."
"PERSON 1: A cheque.
PERSON 2: The refund for Tuttle!
PERSON 1: Tuttle?
PERSON 2: I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
PERSON 1: I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
PERSON 2: We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
PERSON 1: Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
PERSON 2: I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
PERSON 1: Hang on."
"PERSON 1: Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
PERSON 2: I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless."
"PERSON 1: ...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
PERSON 2: Nice, Jane."
"PERSON 1: Hey, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Hey."
"PERSON 1: Why?
PERSON 2: For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
PERSON 1: I don't know.
PERSON 2: Please, PERSON 1ton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
PERSON 1: It's from the first World War, isn't it?
PERSON 2: There are straps in back."
"PERSON 1: Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
PERSON 2: Praying.
PERSON 1: PERSON 2. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
PERSON 2: If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!"
"PERSON 1: This is nuts.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
PERSON 1: 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
PERSON 2: His girlfriend?
PERSON 1: Yes, his girlfriend.
PERSON 2: You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
PERSON 1: Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: Doesn't that strike you as odd?
PERSON 2: No. She's probably scared to death.
PERSON 1: Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
PERSON 2: Maybe.
PERSON 1: If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
PERSON 2: You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
PERSON 1: No.
PERSON 2: When was the last time?"
"PERSON 1: I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
PERSON 2: Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?"
"PERSON 1: What's happening?
PERSON 2: They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
PERSON 1: The police...?
PERSON 2: John.
PERSON 1: John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
PERSON 2: How about his job?
PERSON 1: His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
PERSON 2: Tell that to Mr. Takagi."
"PERSON 1: Where?
PERSON 2: Behind Bob's house."
"PERSON 1: That's better.
PERSON 2: Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other."
"PERSON 1: But if you want facts, PERSON 2, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
PERSON 2: Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
PERSON 1: I'll tell him we'll take two."
"PERSON 1: I object, your Honor...
PERSON 2: Overruled...
PERSON 1: Exception!
PERSON 2: Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed..."
"PERSON 1: That's probably my office.
PERSON 2: Well? Where the hell are you?
PERSON 1: He's on the move?
PERSON 2: I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
PERSON 1: Let's do it."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, that was our house!
PERSON 2: I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
PERSON 1: Let me out, PERSON 2.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
PERSON 2: I think I'd like a little company."
"PERSON 1: Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
PERSON 2: I thought he was out of town.
PERSON 1: He is.
PERSON 2: Then don't hassle it."
"PERSON 1: It came.
PERSON 1: 800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
PERSON 2: Very generous
PERSON 1: And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
PERSON 2: To do what?
PERSON 1: That's for me to decide.
PERSON 2: You're going to destroy it
PERSON 1: No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
PERSON 2: You're lying to me.
PERSON 1: We already made the same offer to the stockholders."
"PERSON 1: What... do you remember?
PERSON 2: Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
PERSON 1: I see...
PERSON 2: Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not PERSON 2."
"PERSON 1: Huh?
PERSON 2: Are you all right?
PERSON 1: Yeah, I'm all right."
"PERSON 1: I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
PERSON 2: You'd have been proud of her.
PERSON 1: I'm sure.
PERSON 2: She was a revelation...
PERSON 1: To you, too?
PERSON 2: What do you mean?
PERSON 1: I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
PERSON 2: That's beside the point.
PERSON 1: It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!"
"PERSON 1: Wally...
PERSON 2: I know, I know."
"PERSON 1: We went about together.
PERSON 2: Really?
PERSON 1: Yes, while he was here.
PERSON 2: While he was here. You went about together?
PERSON 1: He was here for four days.
PERSON 2: Was he?
PERSON 1: Could you do me a favour?
PERSON 2: Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
PERSON 1: Could you please put my glass on the table?"
"PERSON 1: Mind if I smoke a jay?
PERSON 2: Bunny."
"PERSON 1: Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
PERSON 2: Yes."
"PERSON 1: Are you making an ass of yourself?
PERSON 2: There's only you, PERSON 1.  You know what, PERSON 1?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
PERSON 1: I don't need a drug.
PERSON 2: You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words."
"PERSON 1: Is she still angry?
PERSON 2: No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
PERSON 1: I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous."
"PERSON 1: Thank you...
PERSON 2: Its good, right?"
"PERSON 1: Don't... don't say that to me...
PERSON 2: Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!"
"PERSON 1: Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
PERSON 2: My guards are from South Africa, Mr. PERSON 1. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward."
"PERSON 1: Anybody home?
PERSON 2: As a matter of fact--
PERSON 1: Sir?
PERSON 2: As a matter of fact--I am home.
PERSON 1: Hello.
PERSON 2: Hello.
PERSON 1: Are you--"
"PERSON 1: You really liked it?
PERSON 2: At the end of every chapter --"
"PERSON 1: ...PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: You're bad."
"PERSON 1: Make them eat the figurine.
PERSON 2: They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
PERSON 1: ...tell them..."
"PERSON 1: I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
PERSON 2: Really?
PERSON 1: Mio caro Adone.
PERSON 2: Ah!
PERSON 1: A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things."
"PERSON 1: Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
PERSON 2: Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes."
"PERSON 1: To see how long it would take for me to realize.
PERSON 2: Realize?
PERSON 1: You weren't real."
"PERSON 1: I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
PERSON 2: Why?
PERSON 1: I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
PERSON 2: Then you must spend your life answering questions."
"PERSON 1: It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
PERSON 2: Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --"
"PERSON 1: Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
PERSON 2: Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
PERSON 1: I know damn well she's there."
"PERSON 1: Let's go.
PERSON 2: Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, are you crazy?
PERSON 2: I know what I'm doing... Go!"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
PERSON 2: I know, PERSON 1.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere."
"PERSON 1: I do it for love.
PERSON 2: 'Bye PERSON 1...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment."
"PERSON 1: Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
PERSON 2: What about surface life signs...?
PERSON 1: Close... There --
PERSON 2: Come on!"
"PERSON 1: ...mmm.
PERSON 2: ...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
PERSON 1: Is today Laundry Day...?"
"PERSON 1: What's so funny?
PERSON 2: Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
PERSON 1: God, Fred...
PERSON 2: At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
PERSON 1: No? Why not?
PERSON 2: You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
PERSON 1: Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?"
"PERSON 1: Where's the dog now?
PERSON 2: He left me."
"PERSON 1: Should we bring the police into this?
PERSON 2: No, not yet."
"PERSON 1: He's in tachycardia.  PERSON 2, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
PERSON 2: Coke.
PERSON 1: Cocaine?  How much?
PERSON 2: I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
PERSON 1: In how long?  A week?
PERSON 2: Today.
PERSON 1: Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack."
"PERSON 1: Somebody's there, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Come on, PERSON 1. A man's not made of stone.
PERSON 1: Let's go back, PERSON 2...
PERSON 2: I need you so much, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: I have that date -- remember?
PERSON 2: I love you -- remember?"
"PERSON 1: They all know you?
PERSON 2: 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?"
"PERSON 1: Miami?
PERSON 2: Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
PERSON 1: Jai alai?
PERSON 2: Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton."
"PERSON 1: His home would be... Mount Olympus.
PERSON 2: Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed."
"PERSON 1: Pregnant, is she?
PERSON 2: It would appear so."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2...
PERSON 2: No."
"PERSON 1: Get up.
PERSON 2: Feels so good to lie here.
PERSON 1: Get up, damn you."
"PERSON 1: Oh, right.
PERSON 2: This is your house, right?"
"PERSON 1: Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
PERSON 2: How the hell do you know that?
PERSON 1: A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
PERSON 2: So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
PERSON 1: I believe I should interview the widow alone.
PERSON 2: Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife."
"PERSON 1: It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
PERSON 2: If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!"
"PERSON 1: C'mon.  I want to know.
PERSON 2: Want to know what, exactly?
PERSON 1: What it was like.
PERSON 2: It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
PERSON 1: Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
PERSON 2: What's the difference?
PERSON 1: You know the difference.
PERSON 2: Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
PERSON 1: Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?"
"PERSON 1: A what...?
PERSON 2: A SNAKE!!"
"PERSON 1: We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
PERSON 2: Patience, Colonel PERSON 1.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga..."
"PERSON 1: How was it?
PERSON 2: We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?"
"PERSON 1: Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
PERSON 2: What for?
PERSON 1: I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
PERSON 2: Gas?"
"PERSON 1: Are you sure?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: It just seems...kind of weird.
PERSON 2: Why?
PERSON 1: I don't know.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
PERSON 1: No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
PERSON 2: And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or..."
"PERSON 1: I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
PERSON 2: What are you talkin' about?
PERSON 1: You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
PERSON 2: I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
PERSON 1: The bet's off."
"PERSON 1: How did you know it was Captain Charles?
PERSON 2: I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
PERSON 1: Can you give me a drink, please?
PERSON 2: Yes, of course.  What do you want?"
"PERSON 1: I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
PERSON 2: If Lenin were alive he would say, ""Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times.""
PERSON 1: He wouldn't say that. What he would say is ""Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"""
"PERSON 1: Chief....
PERSON 2: PERSON 1.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908."
"PERSON 1: In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
PERSON 2: On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
"PERSON 1: I'll wait... back there.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I... thank..."
"PERSON 1: You got that big retarded girl down there?
PERSON 2: Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
PERSON 1: Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
PERSON 2: I'll get them before ""Touched by an Angel,"" don't worry.
PERSON 1: You damn well better..."
"PERSON 1: Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
PERSON 2: Even the skylight?
PERSON 1: The ""skylight?"" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
PERSON 2: What about ""climbing in?"""
"PERSON 1: Wait in the car.
PERSON 2: You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
PERSON 1: I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
PERSON 2: In the trunk?
PERSON 1: The backseat."
"PERSON 1: Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
PERSON 2: Relax.
PERSON 1: It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
PERSON 2: Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
PERSON 1: Freddie?
PERSON 2: Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip."
"PERSON 1: Well what about the new Echo --
PERSON 2: Do not get ahead of yourself."
"PERSON 1: Go to the bathroom.
PERSON 2: Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!"
"PERSON 1: If you'll excuse me......
PERSON 2: No-o!"
"PERSON 1: The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
PERSON 2: True.
PERSON 1: And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
PERSON 2: Correct."
"PERSON 1: Can... can... Can I have this?
PERSON 2: Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway."
"PERSON 1: Isn't that awfully forward?
PERSON 2: We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come."
"PERSON 1: Hello? Hello! Ginger.
PERSON 2: Help, Daddy!"
"PERSON 1: Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
PERSON 2: I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
PERSON 1: Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
PERSON 2: Would you like me to take you through your lines?
PERSON 1: Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
PERSON 2: Hand it over.  Basic plot?
PERSON 1: I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
PERSON 2: Well done you."
"PERSON 1: Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
PERSON 2: I'm sure you will.
PERSON 1: Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
PERSON 2: Oh..."
"PERSON 1: I believe you won decorations during the war.
PERSON 2: Two."
"PERSON 1: Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
PERSON 2: You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here."
"PERSON 1: What now?!
PERSON 2: Wait a minute ..."
"PERSON 1: That should make her happy.
PERSON 2: Who's she?
PERSON 1: Don't know. Who is she?"
"PERSON 1: Leggo. I got to wash it out.
PERSON 2: Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then."
"PERSON 1: I don't know -- they've always been there.
PERSON 2: That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used."
"PERSON 1: Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
PERSON 2: Oh shurrup and come on PERSON 1. They're waiting for you in the studio."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, what's the matter?
PERSON 2: It's my birthday.
PERSON 1: It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?"
"PERSON 1: What do you want?
PERSON 2: What do you mean?
PERSON 1: You know what I mean."
"PERSON 1: Would you have shot if it was a man?
PERSON 2: No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
PERSON 1: The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
PERSON 2: That's not right.
PERSON 1: That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
PERSON 2: I think you're the liar.
PERSON 1: I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
PERSON 2: We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
PERSON 1: You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?"
"PERSON 1: Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
PERSON 2: Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
PERSON 1: That he was.
PERSON 2: They're making him a hero now.
PERSON 1: Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
PERSON 2: But he killed a lot of men, too.
PERSON 1: Can't argue that.
PERSON 2: So what was he?
PERSON 1: I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around."
"PERSON 1: Dad!
PERSON 2: Hi, kiddo.
PERSON 1: Meet Nick."
"PERSON 1: 
PERSON 2: EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY."
"PERSON 1: It is not beautiful.
PERSON 2: You read my thoughts, Mr. PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
PERSON 2: You can't really believe that."
"PERSON 1: I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
PERSON 2: What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
PERSON 1: Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, ""Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk"" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier."
"PERSON 1: ...and how long did she work here?
PERSON 2: Oh, five years, give or take.
PERSON 1: Hmm... you two in high school together?
PERSON 2: Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
PERSON 1: But she wanted more out of life, right?
PERSON 2: No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
PERSON 1: I see.  May I?
PERSON 2: If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
PERSON 1: Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
PERSON 2: ...who doesn't?"
"PERSON 1: Sun...
PERSON 2: Yes.
PERSON 1: Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
PERSON 2: Yes. Day... night.
PERSON 1: How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
PERSON 2: Three nights... two days.
PERSON 1: That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
PERSON 2: I need you.
PERSON 1: I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
PERSON 2: No.
PERSON 1: You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
PERSON 2: No.
PERSON 1: Then let me go. You don't need me.
PERSON 2: No.
PERSON 1: I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you."
"PERSON 1: Before you go...
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: Just one kiss. For old times' sake."
"PERSON 1: Don't be late.
PERSON 2: I won't...."
"PERSON 1: Oh, will you stop attacking PERSON 2?!
PERSON 2: Oh, now--
PERSON 1: She's going through a really rough time right now."
"PERSON 1: What are you going to do?
PERSON 2: Go down there and kill everybody, I guess."
"PERSON 1: I'll have whatever she's having.
PERSON 2: I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
PERSON 1: Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning."
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you PERSON 2 McCord?!
PERSON 2: ...What? What did you call me? PERSON 2... McCord. You're my favorite actor on..."
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm."
"PERSON 1: The what?
PERSON 2: The ringer!  The ringer, PERSON 1!  Have they called yet?"
"PERSON 1: You heard about your father?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
PERSON 2: Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
PERSON 1: Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
PERSON 2: How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
PERSON 1: Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
PERSON 2: Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
PERSON 1: That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
PERSON 2: No, just you and Paulie."
"PERSON 1: Is she a good fuck?
PERSON 2: What??
PERSON 1: I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that."
"PERSON 1: We...we could go home with something else.
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: With...with millions.  Millions of dollars."
"PERSON 1: Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
PERSON 2: How old are you, young man?
PERSON 1: Nineteen, sir.
PERSON 2: Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
PERSON 1: But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
PERSON 2: Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
PERSON 1: But, sir...
PERSON 2: I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher."
"PERSON 1: A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
PERSON 2: A match for your son, I think.
PERSON 1: A fine match.
PERSON 2: They will have the life that you and I might have had."
"PERSON 1: Who told you to look at Elektras files?
PERSON 2: I took the initiative.
PERSON 1: You havent been given an assignPERSON 1ent in this case.
PERSON 2: I was the one who brought that PERSON 1oney in...
PERSON 1: IPERSON 1 well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
PERSON 2: The aPERSON 1ount of PERSON 1oney that killed Robert King is the saPERSON 1e aPERSON 1ount as the ransoPERSON 1 dePERSON 1and for Elektra."
"PERSON 1: What are you doing?
PERSON 2: Cover...our footsteps..."
"PERSON 1: I mean, he loves his job.
PERSON 2: Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four..."
"PERSON 1: I don't think so.
PERSON 2: Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
PERSON 1: No."
"PERSON 1: He doesn't want to fight.
PERSON 2: Get out of the way.
PERSON 1: No, PERSON 2. This isn't --"
"PERSON 1: Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
PERSON 2: Really?
PERSON 1: With a vengeance, I hated them.
PERSON 2: How come?
PERSON 1: I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun."
"PERSON 1: What ""magic"" have you brought, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: You'll see!"
"PERSON 1: It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
PERSON 2: You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits..."
"PERSON 1: Who?
PERSON 2: The mean old man with the claws."
"PERSON 1: We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
PERSON 2: You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
PERSON 1: Whatever."
"PERSON 1: I suppose you'd like the top down.
PERSON 2: If that's okay?
PERSON 1: Nothing would please me more."
"PERSON 1: I don't understand...
PERSON 2: We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something."
"PERSON 1: They're migrants.
PERSON 2: Migrants?
PERSON 1: Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss."
"PERSON 1: I think you'd better sit down.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, the man's a killer."
"PERSON 1: Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
PERSON 2: You hate gambling.
PERSON 1: That's right.  I do, don't I?
PERSON 2: So why do you want to go?
PERSON 1: Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I think I'm going to throw up."
"PERSON 1: Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
PERSON 2: What about it?
PERSON 1: Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
PERSON 2: Molecular-memory.
PERSON 1: Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
PERSON 2: That's the way it was told to me."
"PERSON 1: That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
PERSON 2: Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!"
"PERSON 1: Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
PERSON 2: Are all of you named Jones?
PERSON 1: Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it."
"PERSON 1: We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
PERSON 2: On screen."
"PERSON 1: Isn't Skye amazing?
PERSON 2: She's got great tits.
PERSON 1: She's a constant surprise.
PERSON 2: And you've only just met.
PERSON 1: Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
PERSON 2: Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
PERSON 1: Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
PERSON 2: The camera loves her.  A great actress.
PERSON 1: With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them."
"PERSON 1: <i></i> I beg your pardon?
PERSON 2: I didn't say anything."
"PERSON 1: You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
PERSON 2: You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
PERSON 1: FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!"
"PERSON 1: Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, PERSON 2! I mean, what do you think?
PERSON 2: I know, but...
PERSON 1: What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, PERSON 2. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
PERSON 2: Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired."
