conversation
"PERSON 1: My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
PERSON 2: Divorce?  Never!"
"PERSON 1: ""Sleepless in Seattle""?
PERSON 2: That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
PERSON 1: And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
PERSON 2: Actually, he sounded nice.
PERSON 1: Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
PERSON 2: Not."
"PERSON 1: That's a terrible thing to say.
PERSON 2: So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib."
"PERSON 1: Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
PERSON 2: Stay put!  I know my way around."
"PERSON 1: General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
PERSON 2: He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras."
"PERSON 1: You know what he's really upset about?
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?"
"PERSON 1: Can you fly that thing.
PERSON 2: Not yet."
"PERSON 1: So what is it you want to know?
PERSON 2: I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
PERSON 1: Created?
PERSON 2: Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern PERSON 1urai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
PERSON 1: Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of PERSON 1urai.
PERSON 2: You seem one to me.
PERSON 1: A PERSON 1urai has honor, a PERSON 1urai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival."
"PERSON 1: Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
PERSON 2: Possible.  So you did those wings?
PERSON 1: Yeah.  A long time ago.
PERSON 2: They're harder to do than they look.
PERSON 1: Oh?  You've tried?
PERSON 2: Well, I do a little drawing --"
"PERSON 1: Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
PERSON 2: Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
PERSON 1: Please, PERSON 2, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?"
"PERSON 1: You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
PERSON 2: Thank you ever so.
PERSON 1: You're welcome.
PERSON 2: It's entirely mutual."
"PERSON 1: I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
PERSON 2: I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that."
"PERSON 1: Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
PERSON 2: Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
PERSON 1: Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse."
"PERSON 1: It's a woman shot in a car?
PERSON 2: Yes.  I have to go...
PERSON 1: She on the passenger side?"
"PERSON 1: Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
PERSON 2: So where are you now?
PERSON 1: Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
PERSON 2: Shit.
PERSON 1: Get this! He called and invited me to dinner."
"PERSON 1: Jesus PERSON 2 you're going to O.D. him.
PERSON 2: Suck my ass."
"PERSON 1: Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
PERSON 2: Alright!
PERSON 1: Could take a little while, though.
PERSON 2: What's a ""little while?""
PERSON 1: Two.. maybe three days."
"PERSON 1: Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
PERSON 2: Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card."
"PERSON 1: You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
PERSON 2: Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
PERSON 1: Why don't you leave this town - go home?"
"PERSON 1: You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
PERSON 2: Really?
PERSON 1: Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
PERSON 2: Mm.
PERSON 1: ""It's not a job, it's an adventure."" Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
PERSON 2: You cut off your little finger?
PERSON 1: Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
PERSON 2: Let's see."
"PERSON 1: This is the Nexus?
PERSON 2: For you. This is where you wanted to be.
PERSON 1: But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
PERSON 2: Enjoy them, Jean-Luc."
"PERSON 1: Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
PERSON 2: Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... PERSON 1?
PERSON 1: Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
PERSON 2: Oh, I don't know, PERSON 1. I'm at work all the time.
PERSON 1: Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
PERSON 2: Next Saturday?
PERSON 1: Yeah.
PERSON 2: Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
PERSON 1: Okay. Do."
"PERSON 1: Shall I answer it?
PERSON 2: No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week."
"PERSON 1: Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
PERSON 2: It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
PERSON 1: Are you lovesick?
PERSON 2: Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
PERSON 1: Will champagne help?
PERSON 2: Not enough."
"PERSON 1: I don't get it.
PERSON 2: Let me talk to you."
"PERSON 1: Jen, listen ...
PERSON 2: I like--really need a cigarette, too.
PERSON 1: I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home."
"PERSON 1: Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
PERSON 2: The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
PERSON 1: I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. PERSON 2 is looking around the piano. PERSON 1 giggles.
PERSON 2: Is something funny?
PERSON 1: No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
PERSON 2: I've met you before.
PERSON 1: I don't think so."
"PERSON 1: Let's dance together -- PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: No, PERSON 1 -- your place is with your wife --"
"PERSON 1: Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: Why do you need that much?
PERSON 2: Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
PERSON 1: Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
PERSON 2: I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
PERSON 1: Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for."
"PERSON 1: ...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, ""You rat, you are the murderer."" So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, ""How could you do that?"" And he says, ""It was easy.""
PERSON 2: Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write."
"PERSON 1: Maybe she's right.
PERSON 2: Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!"
"PERSON 1: How come you don't hate their guts?
PERSON 2: I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
PERSON 1: You were plenty scared that night in the car.
PERSON 2: Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
PERSON 1: Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
PERSON 2: Not if you see them for what they are, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth."
"PERSON 1: Stop calling me Mother!
PERSON 2: All right, Grandma
PERSON 1: This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2... You okay?
PERSON 2: Yeah."
"PERSON 1: I got it. PERSON 2 get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
PERSON 2: What am I? The beer wench?
PERSON 1: Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?"
"PERSON 1: Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
PERSON 2: I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
PERSON 1: ...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
PERSON 2: You have to what?"
"PERSON 1: Uh, yes... Sure, David.
PERSON 2: All right. Speak to you then."
"PERSON 1: Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
PERSON 2: Heaven help me, I love a psychotic."
"PERSON 1: If they can't see you, what's the point?
PERSON 2: Survive today, that's the point."
"PERSON 1: Nothing for you to see.
PERSON 2: Leggo..."
"PERSON 1: You fucking promised.
PERSON 2: Did I?
PERSON 1: You fucking did."
"PERSON 1: So they'll go.
PERSON 2: I'm only paying two of you guys."
"PERSON 1: White House PERSON 1. How may I direct your call.
PERSON 2: Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
PERSON 1: who can I say is calling?
PERSON 2: This is the President.
PERSON 1: Yeah, right.
PERSON 2: Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
PERSON 1: Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
PERSON 2: You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone."
"PERSON 1: ""Liberty, Virtue, Country""... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
PERSON 2: When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
PERSON 1: When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
PERSON 2: That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you..."
"PERSON 1: Yes, we do know each other.  I'm PERSON 1 Jones.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1 Jones."
"PERSON 1: Did you call the Zoo?
PERSON 2: Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
PERSON 1: Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
PERSON 2: The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
PERSON 1: Good God.
PERSON 2: They suggested oranges."
"PERSON 1: It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
PERSON 2: You're not from beyond the valley.
PERSON 1: What makes you say that?"
"PERSON 1: Give me the shooter, PERSON 2 --
PERSON 2: You're crazy --
PERSON 1: Give me the fucking shooter!"
"PERSON 1: He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
PERSON 2: Yeah, that's what happened..."
"PERSON 1: How'd the show go?
PERSON 2: Okay.  How'd yours go?
PERSON 1: Not so good."
"PERSON 1: Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
PERSON 2: Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
PERSON 1: Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
PERSON 2: How'd you get the job?
PERSON 1: Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy."
"PERSON 1: I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
PERSON 2: What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
PERSON 1: Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
PERSON 2: Funny.  Strike a bell?
PERSON 1: It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
PERSON 2: It's more than that."
"PERSON 1: Let me get your change.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee."
"PERSON 1: And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
PERSON 2: That is sedition! Treason!
PERSON 1: That is the truth!
PERSON 2: I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
PERSON 1: Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement."
"PERSON 1: Eating solid breakfasts, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Sir?
PERSON 1: All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
PERSON 2: I take the skin off chicken."
"PERSON 1: Definitely!
PERSON 2: I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day."
"PERSON 1: They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
PERSON 2: You better."
"PERSON 1: Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
PERSON 2: Don't be smart.
PERSON 1: I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?"
"PERSON 1: Yeah. So who the fuck does?
PERSON 2: Come on. Tell us, Shitface."
"PERSON 1: You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
PERSON 2: Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln."
"PERSON 1: What are we supposed to talk about?
PERSON 2: You've gotta be kidding?
PERSON 1: But, they don't speak English.
PERSON 2: There are some things that everybody does in the same language."
"PERSON 1: Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
PERSON 2: Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning."
"PERSON 1: Shall we adjourn?
PERSON 2: But the matter's still on the table, Bill --"
"PERSON 1: Do you know I turnPERSON 2 down ""Frankenstein""?
PERSON 2: Huh?
PERSON 1: After I did ""Dracula,"" the studio offerPERSON 2 me ""Frankenstein""!  But I turnPERSON 2 it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me."
"PERSON 1: I talk to her or you can forget about it.
PERSON 2: Don't you threaten me.
PERSON 1: What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
PERSON 2: You know what I'm gonna do.
PERSON 1: What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?"
"PERSON 1: Let's just slow down for a second...
PERSON 2: You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
PERSON 1: No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut."
"PERSON 1: Who's in charge here?
PERSON 2: I am. What do you want?
PERSON 1: You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
PERSON 2: Forget it. No way. I got here first.
PERSON 1: Who's Wade?"
"PERSON 1: A late night or an early morning?
PERSON 2: Late night.  You?
PERSON 1: Were you with Jamie?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: You sleeping with her?"
"PERSON 1: You've done much of this work before?
PERSON 2: Never."
"PERSON 1: Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
PERSON 2: We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --"
"PERSON 1: I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
PERSON 2: Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
PERSON 1: Yeah, they're in the snow."
"PERSON 1: Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
PERSON 2: Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
PERSON 1: Do you want to talk about it?"
"PERSON 1: Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
PERSON 2: How I make my living, what's your point?
PERSON 1: This."
"PERSON 1: Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
PERSON 2: No, I'm going.
PERSON 1: The Shawfish?
PERSON 2: Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
PERSON 1: Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
PERSON 2: I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you."
"PERSON 1: General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
PERSON 2: We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
PERSON 1: Yes, what else?
PERSON 2: Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively."
"PERSON 1: Oh my God!  Bernie!
PERSON 2: Dad!"
"PERSON 1: Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.

PERSON 2: Yeah, right here."
"PERSON 1: The royal...studs?
PERSON 2: You see the top yardarm, now look to the-"
"PERSON 1: No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
PERSON 2: No... this is the first time for me, too."
"PERSON 1: Yes?
PERSON 2: Your father was a schoolmaster?
PERSON 1: Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one."
"PERSON 1: I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
PERSON 2: Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs."
"PERSON 1: I'll share something with you.
PERSON 2: I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money."
"PERSON 1: The Royal.
PERSON 2: Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
PERSON 1: Couple years.
PERSON 2: February?
PERSON 1: April.
PERSON 2: Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
PERSON 1: A useless talent.
PERSON 2: Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ..."
"PERSON 1: Tell me.  Please.
PERSON 2: That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear."
"PERSON 1: What do we do?
PERSON 2: We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot."
"PERSON 1: You look like you've had quite a work-out.
PERSON 2: It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
PERSON 1: I know it, I know it.
PERSON 2: ... this doing hair it's...
PERSON 1: I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, don't fall asleep in there.
PERSON 2: I won't.
PERSON 1: Get into bed.
PERSON 2: I will."
"PERSON 1: What, sweetheart?
PERSON 2: I want to see Pilgrim."
"PERSON 1: Wiz?
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
PERSON 2: Shoot. They don't call me the PERSON 2 for nothing.
PERSON 1: Well, I just, you know...
PERSON 2: Things got ya down?
PERSON 1: Real down.
PERSON 2: It happens.
PERSON 1: Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
PERSON 2: The taxi life, you mean.
PERSON 1: Yeah.
PERSON 2: I know.
PERSON 1: Like do anything, you know.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am."
"PERSON 1: What are movies about, Orson?
PERSON 2: Forget it-
PERSON 1: What are movies about?
PERSON 2: Telling stories.
PERSON 1: Nope.
PERSON 2: Showing life
PERSON 1: Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde."
"PERSON 1: I'm tired, PERSON 2.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
PERSON 2: My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
PERSON 1: Yes.  You see, the truth is, PERSON 2, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
PERSON 2: The Matrix isn't real!
PERSON 1: Oh, I disagree, PERSON 2.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die."
"PERSON 1: I was here the whole time.
PERSON 2: You two better quit it."
"PERSON 1: That you, boy?
PERSON 2: It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
PERSON 1: It's pay day, ain't it?
PERSON 2: I wanted to talk to you about that.
PERSON 1: I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!"
"PERSON 1: Scottish.
PERSON 2: Tom Jones?"
"PERSON 1: This is fun...
PERSON 2: Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?"
"PERSON 1: They don't want to come down.
PERSON 2: Why not?"
"PERSON 1: Right!
PERSON 2: We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry."
"PERSON 1: Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
PERSON 2: We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, what's in that case?
PERSON 2: Haven't you opened it?
PERSON 1: No, why should I? It's yours.
PERSON 2: It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
PERSON 1: From a rich old man who used to be my lover."
"PERSON 1: No, we...got our butts kicked.
PERSON 2: Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky."
"PERSON 1: You gonna be alright?
PERSON 2: Sure. I'm sorry.
PERSON 1: No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
PERSON 2: Get some more beer.
PERSON 1: I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
PERSON 2: Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you."
"PERSON 1: -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
PERSON 2: I don't understand."
"PERSON 1: Is this your first time?
PERSON 2: Yes."
"PERSON 1: Let us settle this tomorrow.
PERSON 2: Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs."
"PERSON 1: Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
PERSON 2: Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man."
"PERSON 1: Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
PERSON 2: There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
PERSON 1: What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
PERSON 2: Is it true?"
"PERSON 1: Patrick?
PERSON 2: Yes?
PERSON 1: Nothing."
"PERSON 1: I know David - a strange character.
PERSON 2: He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy."
"PERSON 1: I better get going.
PERSON 2: You don't have to burst in here every time, PERSON 1.  Just call and make an appointment."
"PERSON 1: I'm not dressed.
PERSON 2: Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley."
"PERSON 1: Glorious, analytical...
PERSON 2: The telephone is ringing.
PERSON 1: Oh, let it ring.
PERSON 2: But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer."
"PERSON 1: I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
PERSON 2: Your blood, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
PERSON 2: A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons."
"PERSON 1: How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
PERSON 2: How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?"
"PERSON 1: Uh, PERSON 2?!  We missed the truck!
PERSON 2: We're not aiming for the truck!"
"PERSON 1: That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
PERSON 2: That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
PERSON 1: Whose tuba is that anyway?
PERSON 2: Miss Sloviak's.
PERSON 1: Can I ask you something about her?
PERSON 2: She is. Ah. Here we go..."
"PERSON 1: We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
PERSON 2: Here?"
"PERSON 1: When I wanted to.
PERSON 2: It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty."
"PERSON 1: Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. ""Mur, this new kid burns my ass."" ""Shelly, he's out."" You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
PERSON 2: I have to go..."
"PERSON 1: Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
PERSON 2: We don't know that, PERSON 1..."
"PERSON 1: Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
PERSON 2: I've never been so hungry in my life..."
"PERSON 1: I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
PERSON 2: I'm glad you came to me for help."
"PERSON 1: Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
PERSON 2: ...closed?"
"PERSON 1: I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
PERSON 2: It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive."
"PERSON 1: It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
PERSON 2: Maybe next time."
"PERSON 1: Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
PERSON 2: I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
PERSON 1: He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
PERSON 2: Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
PERSON 1: Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
PERSON 2: I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
PERSON 1: You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?"
"PERSON 1: Tell me what you need.
PERSON 2: I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts."
"PERSON 1: Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
PERSON 2: All right."
"PERSON 1: ""...Good Lord willing, things'll work out.""
PERSON 2: Yep.  So how's Annie?"
"PERSON 1: Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
PERSON 2: That's government property, Major.
PERSON 1: Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere."
"PERSON 1: [I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
PERSON 2: [Who ordered it?]
PERSON 1: [The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
PERSON 2: [Where do I find him?]
PERSON 1: [I don't know. No one knows.]"
"PERSON 1: Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
PERSON 2: This young woman."
"PERSON 1: There.
PERSON 2: Where?"
"PERSON 1: Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... PERSON 2, I don't know how ...
PERSON 2: Forget it."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
PERSON 2: Yes.
PERSON 1: How come you're not wearing my shoes?
PERSON 2: They're too big."
"PERSON 1: Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
PERSON 2: Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, we need to talk.
PERSON 2: What is it, PERSON 1?
PERSON 1: I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
PERSON 2: That's why we came here, remember?
PERSON 1: Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
PERSON 2: Whoa, PERSON 1, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. PERSON 1, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves."
"PERSON 1: Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
PERSON 2: You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
PERSON 1: Yes."
"PERSON 1: You all right back there, mate?
PERSON 2: Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
PERSON 1: It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
PERSON 2: Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
PERSON 1: All right, furry muff."
"PERSON 1: I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
PERSON 2: Just go!"
"PERSON 1: If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
PERSON 2: How grave?
PERSON 1: Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS."
"PERSON 1: Gas?
PERSON 2: Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?"
"PERSON 1: The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, PERSON 2!
PERSON 2: Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
PERSON 1: The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
PERSON 2: Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
PERSON 2: Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
PERSON 1: Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
PERSON 2: How do you know?
PERSON 1: No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock."
"PERSON 1: Lay them down.
PERSON 2: Eh?
PERSON 1: Lay them down.
PERSON 2: We'd be thrown out.
PERSON 1: Your cards... lay them down... face up."
"PERSON 1: What's going on?
PERSON 2: Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there."
"PERSON 1: I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
PERSON 2: Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
PERSON 1: Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour."
"PERSON 1: I'm PERSON 1. You must be PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Yes, ma'am.
PERSON 1: How's your twenty?"
"PERSON 1: No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
PERSON 2: Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?"
"PERSON 1: Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
PERSON 2: You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
PERSON 1: Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now."
"PERSON 1: Are you afraid?
PERSON 2: Yes."
"PERSON 1: Buffy!
PERSON 2: What is she..."
"PERSON 1: They're not gonna let us in PERSON 2, we're kids.
PERSON 2: We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
PERSON 1: Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
PERSON 2: Duck!"
"PERSON 1: Same way you did.  Through that gate.
PERSON 2: I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
PERSON 1: All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff PERSON 2 is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
PERSON 2: Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
PERSON 1: Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
PERSON 2: Oh, that'll be all right, PERSON 1. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?"
"PERSON 1: Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
PERSON 2: What are you talking about, PERSON 1?"
"PERSON 1: I want you to have this.
PERSON 2: What is it?
PERSON 1: It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
PERSON 2: I don't believe in luck.
PERSON 1: Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
PERSON 2: Thank you."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
PERSON 2: Roger."
"PERSON 1: --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
PERSON 2: --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
PERSON 1: --quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--"
"PERSON 1: Are you chewing gum?
PERSON 2: Want some?"
"PERSON 1: Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
PERSON 2: Cute, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: Hi, whatcha doing?
PERSON 2: Just thinking.
PERSON 1: Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?"
"PERSON 1: No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
PERSON 2: Good idea!"
"PERSON 1: Wow....huh...""...piss and shit...""
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: You really use strong language.
PERSON 2: I'm sorry --
PERSON 1: -- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
PERSON 2: I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
PERSON 1: It's fine.
PERSON 2: I'm sorry.
PERSON 1: ...nothing.  I'm sorry...
PERSON 2: No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
PERSON 1: -- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
PERSON 2: I'm sorry.
PERSON 2: I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
PERSON 1: ok.
PERSON 2: ok."
"PERSON 1: Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
PERSON 2: We're not leaving you here, sir !"
"PERSON 1: I thought you were one of my friends.
PERSON 2: I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
PERSON 1: Yes--are you?
PERSON 2: I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
PERSON 1: She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
PERSON 2: I'll say she is!
PERSON 1: Nice lines--
PERSON 2: Yes--"
"PERSON 1: What what are you doing? We're cover!
PERSON 2: Wood's okay. I want Viper."
"PERSON 1: Peace, everybody--PERSON 2, Penelope.
PERSON 2: You're taking Mom out tonight?
PERSON 1: You're going out?"
"PERSON 1: Were you with another man?
PERSON 2: Go to hell.
PERSON 1: I'll take that as a no.
PERSON 2: Are we done for today?
PERSON 1: I believe we are."
"PERSON 1: Don't go.
PERSON 2: This is important to me.
PERSON 1: Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down."
"PERSON 1: What do you think?
PERSON 2: He seems pretty good."
"PERSON 1: Not yet, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: When?"
"PERSON 1: One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
PERSON 2: So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
PERSON 1: Aye, but will they?
PERSON 2: John, it's not your problem what she eats.
PERSON 1: The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight."
"PERSON 1: Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
PERSON 2: We're missing two of the kids!
PERSON 1: Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out."
"PERSON 1: Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
PERSON 2: Why? There's no food in the house?
PERSON 1: No. I just thought... forget it."
"PERSON 1: That's my father. I got to run.
PERSON 2: Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?"
"PERSON 1: Bloom!
PERSON 2: Don.
PERSON 1: What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
PERSON 2: I didn't know she belonged to anybody."
"PERSON 1: You know what Sanford told me?
PERSON 2: I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
PERSON 1: Julie Dwyer died.
PERSON 2: Yeah, right.
PERSON 1: No, I'm serious."
"PERSON 1: ... Her father.
PERSON 2: Right. And how did she dress him?
PERSON 1: ... Like Prince Charming.
PERSON 2: Nice ... Nice ..."
"PERSON 1: We got time off for good behavior.
PERSON 2: There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men."
"PERSON 1: I am Dr. Norbert PERSON 1--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
PERSON 2: Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?"
"PERSON 1: I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
PERSON 2: Are we?"
"PERSON 1: Jesse, help!
PERSON 2: I'm Jesse now, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: Would you mind moving along, please?
PERSON 2: Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht."
"PERSON 1: You were saying?
PERSON 2: Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend."
"PERSON 1: Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
PERSON 2: I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs."
"PERSON 1: Was that about the right angle?
PERSON 2: I think so.
PERSON 1: Where's the shell?
PERSON 2: Should be over there."
"PERSON 1: Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, PERSON 2, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you."
"PERSON 1: What's ya sister like to do?
PERSON 2: Ice skate.
PERSON 1: I didn't want no turkey anyway."
"PERSON 1: What a surprise.
PERSON 2: Take as much room as you want"
"PERSON 1: Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
PERSON 2: All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
PERSON 1: No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
PERSON 2: Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you."
"PERSON 1: And look who you brought with!
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
PERSON 1: Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
PERSON 2: Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley."
"PERSON 1: You don't find that repugnant?
PERSON 2: Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
PERSON 1: Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
PERSON 2: Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money."
"PERSON 1: You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
PERSON 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
PERSON 1: Cognac?
PERSON 2: I should be checking on the boat.
PERSON 1: The war will still be here tomorrow."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
PERSON 2: You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
PERSON 1: Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
PERSON 2: At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
PERSON 1: I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
PERSON 2: It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. PERSON 1, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there."
"PERSON 1: Oh, that explains everything.
PERSON 2: I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
PERSON 1: That machine --
PERSON 2: Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
PERSON 1: How long ago?
PERSON 2: More than 800,000 years."
"PERSON 1: Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
PERSON 2: Where is she?
PERSON 1: Stalking the wild poltergeist."
"PERSON 1: I hope he doesn't have rabies.
PERSON 2: He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious..."
"PERSON 1: Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
PERSON 2: Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?"
"PERSON 1: You guys are real... aren't you?
PERSON 2: Huh?
PERSON 1: Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
PERSON 2: That's right, buddy."
"PERSON 1: No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, you think everything's a conspiracy.
PERSON 1: Everything is."
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
PERSON 2: At 2.00..."
"PERSON 1: And what you going to do?
PERSON 2: Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
PERSON 1: I'll call the police.
PERSON 2: No, you won't."
"PERSON 1: But it's Christmas now.
PERSON 2: Breakfast.
PERSON 1: What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
PERSON 2: You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back."
"PERSON 1: It's the wrong way!
PERSON 2: In this world, wrong is right!"
"PERSON 1: I think you had better both come inside.
PERSON 2: You're too kind."
"PERSON 1: I just want the job.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, you're not the usual type we get here."
"PERSON 1: What's that?
PERSON 2: You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
PERSON 1: I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
PERSON 2: Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
PERSON 1: Nah.
PERSON 2: Traveling light. I like that."
"PERSON 1: Talk to me.
PERSON 2: I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
PERSON 1: Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?"
"PERSON 1: The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
PERSON 2: But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72."
"PERSON 1: Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
PERSON 2: Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
PERSON 1: We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
PERSON 2: They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
PERSON 1: Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K."
"PERSON 1: What kind of pies do you have?
PERSON 2: Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
PERSON 1: Which do you recommend?
PERSON 2: The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
PERSON 1: I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
PERSON 2: When ya had it, did ya like it?
PERSON 1: No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk."
"PERSON 1: Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
PERSON 2: Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative."
"PERSON 1: I wonder how that...
PERSON 2: Turn it down!"
"PERSON 1: Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
PERSON 2: We'll remember. But that's a long time off..."
"PERSON 1: Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
PERSON 2: I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
PERSON 1: Goddamn it PERSON 2 this really steams my onions!
PERSON 2: Let's get something straight, Chappy!"
"PERSON 1: He's accelerating to Mark 6.
PERSON 2: Mark 12."
"PERSON 1: Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
PERSON 2: That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
PERSON 1: Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
PERSON 2: Please don't call me Lovey."
"PERSON 1: Goddamn, it's cold!
PERSON 2: Once you're in it, it warms up.
PERSON 1: Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D."
"PERSON 1: You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
PERSON 2: Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
PERSON 1: Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
PERSON 2: How am I supposed to know that?
PERSON 1: You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
PERSON 2: Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
PERSON 1: Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!"
"PERSON 1: Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
PERSON 2: I like it. It's kinda...you."
"PERSON 1: What's that?
PERSON 2: Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them."
"PERSON 1: What are you doing here?
PERSON 2: Didn't you call?
PERSON 1: How do you happen to know her?
PERSON 2: I don't.
PERSON 1: Let me show you something."
"PERSON 1: Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
PERSON 2: Look, do you want the bed in or not?
PERSON 1: Just take it slowly.
PERSON 2: Oh, sod you."
"PERSON 1: I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
PERSON 2: If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
PERSON 1: Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
PERSON 2: All right -- it's said!
PERSON 1: Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it."
"PERSON 1: Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
PERSON 2: You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on PERSON 1...what do you want from me?
PERSON 1: I don't want anything you don't wanna give me."
"PERSON 1: You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
PERSON 2: Head-shrinker?"
"PERSON 1: Welcome to Rome, sir.
PERSON 2: Yes way."
"PERSON 1: Tucker?
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you."
"PERSON 1: Stop fighting and get out.
PERSON 2: They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
PERSON 1: Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
PERSON 2: Yes, sir."
"PERSON 1: The stock's going to Pluto!
PERSON 2: Start unloading.
PERSON 1: Sell?
PERSON 2: Now! Tell everyone to dump!"
"PERSON 1: Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
PERSON 2: I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
PERSON 1: Yeah I know.  So what do we do?"
"PERSON 1: Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
PERSON 2: Mmm."
"PERSON 1: Excuse me?
PERSON 2: They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant..."
"PERSON 1: You going to come talk to me or not?
PERSON 2: I'm coming."
"PERSON 1: I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
PERSON 2: Don't drop the guitar, man."
"PERSON 1: Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
PERSON 2: Excellency, you are right."
"PERSON 1: Did you finish thinking?
PERSON 2: I think better when I drive."
"PERSON 1: Something black - something on its way to you 
PERSON 2: Go on -"
"PERSON 1: Hey PERSON 2--you think we'll get any business today?
PERSON 2: I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
PERSON 1: I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
PERSON 2: Change is scary. PERSON 1bie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
PERSON 1: I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time."
"PERSON 1: Where are you going?
PERSON 2: Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
PERSON 1: I was invited. What's your story?
PERSON 2: I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions."
"PERSON 1: Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
PERSON 1: So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
PERSON 2: Hey PERSON 1 why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
PERSON 1: Fuck you PERSON 2."
"PERSON 1: Does Oomie really like this show?
PERSON 2: Isn't it weird? It's her favorite."
"PERSON 1: Yes?
PERSON 2: I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so."
"PERSON 1: Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
PERSON 2: What the fuck is going on?"
"PERSON 1: Hey.
PERSON 2: Hey."
"PERSON 1: Sheriff, what is going on out there?
PERSON 2: All right PERSON 1, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
PERSON 1: Okay.
PERSON 2: Now you understand?
PERSON 1: Uh huh."
"PERSON 1: Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
PERSON 2: LEAVEMEALONE!
PERSON 1: Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
PERSON 2: Who are you?"
"PERSON 1: So you don't mind?
PERSON 2: I've got to finish this chapter anyway."
"PERSON 1: Ah. One of the supporting characters.
PERSON 2: Who?"
"PERSON 1: No... it can't end like that...
PERSON 2: But it has. There is no more to tell.
PERSON 1: But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
PERSON 2: It's over, I'm telling you...
PERSON 1: You need a new passion, PERSON 2, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself."
"PERSON 1: Just him.
PERSON 2: Stay there."
"PERSON 1: Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
PERSON 2: No...couldn't I do this later?"
"PERSON 1: I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
PERSON 2: I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way."
"PERSON 1: Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
PERSON 2: See to it."
"PERSON 1: Nothing's wrong with my skin.
PERSON 2: Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself."
"PERSON 1: You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
PERSON 2: Yeah, well..."
"PERSON 1: Thank you.
PERSON 2: You're welcome."
"PERSON 1: I want you to get out of the water....
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: I want you to give up that terrible job.
PERSON 2: Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
PERSON 1: You're damn right I'm serious....
PERSON 2: I'm just getting started....
PERSON 1: I don't want you in the water anymore...."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2!
PERSON 2: Are we bringing home strays now?"
"PERSON 1: Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
PERSON 2: Yeah, it sucks.
PERSON 1: Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--"
"PERSON 1: Something happened to them, mon.
PERSON 2: Come on, PERSON 1. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?"
"PERSON 1: You?
PERSON 2: That's right, me."
"PERSON 1: Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
PERSON 2: Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  ""Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."""
"PERSON 1: Good.
PERSON 2: He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance."
"PERSON 1: Will you give this to him.
PERSON 2: If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait PERSON 1, he'll contact you."
"PERSON 1: Look, I'm a lawyer and --
PERSON 2: -- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
PERSON 1: ""We""?
PERSON 2: I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. ""Art's Supplies"" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers."
"PERSON 1: Hello, Mr. PERSON 2. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
PERSON 2: Were you supposed to have a session?
PERSON 1: No. It's sort of spur of the moment."
"PERSON 1: Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
PERSON 2: Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
PERSON 1: No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
PERSON 2: You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
PERSON 1: Keep it elevated."
"PERSON 1: For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
PERSON 2: Yes sir."
"PERSON 1: Oh.
PERSON 2: But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. PERSON 1 Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you."
"PERSON 1: Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
PERSON 2: Take some allergy medicine.
PERSON 1: You can't believe this bullshit.
PERSON 2: She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her."
"PERSON 1: What's he got?
PERSON 2: Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment..."
"PERSON 1: Who is it?
PERSON 2: PERSON 2.
PERSON 1: Come on up."
"PERSON 1: The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
PERSON 2: The crowd goes wild.
PERSON 1: 478...
PERSON 2: 0150."
"PERSON 1: Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
PERSON 2: Topol.
PERSON 1: That's right -- Topol.
PERSON 2: But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
PERSON 1: No, well... he was quite a long way away.
PERSON 2: So it could have been neither of them?
PERSON 1: I suppose so.
PERSON 2: Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
PERSON 1: Not classic, no."
"PERSON 1: ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
PERSON 2: Hey."
"PERSON 1: Direct hit -
PERSON 2: Confirmed, Captain!"
"PERSON 1: You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, PERSON 2?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
PERSON 2: Not so far."
"PERSON 1: Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
PERSON 2: Hello...
PERSON 1: Hang on, PERSON 2.  We're conferencing in Sophy."
"PERSON 1: ...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
PERSON 2: It's the best fork of all
PERSON 1: The dessert fork!"
"PERSON 1: Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
PERSON 2: We're not leaving Crutch!
PERSON 1: We don't have time to argue!"
"PERSON 1: Who knows what that is?
PERSON 2: A Jewish prayer.
PERSON 1: Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?"
"PERSON 1: How much homework is there?
PERSON 2: That's the downside. There is none.
PERSON 1: Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
PERSON 2: You can bring whatever you want, little friend."
"PERSON 1: This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
PERSON 2: The very same.
PERSON 1: You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
PERSON 2: I plan to grow on you.
PERSON 1: You're off to a late start.
PERSON 2: So noted."
"PERSON 1: Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
PERSON 2: I've lost my car.
PERSON 1: Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
PERSON 2: It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
PERSON 1: Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars."
"PERSON 1: We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
PERSON 2: Thank you, ma'am..."
"PERSON 1: What? What's wrong?
PERSON 2: Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately."
"PERSON 1: Turn it up, Magda.
PERSON 2: Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her."
"PERSON 1: I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
PERSON 2: So what are you going to do about it?
PERSON 1: What do you want me to do?
PERSON 2: Show him who we are."
"PERSON 1: You see what you're doing, don't you?
PERSON 2: What am I doing?
PERSON 1: You're charming the boy.
PERSON 2: Hey, PERSON 1. He asked me a question.
PERSON 1: Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
PERSON 2: That's my cousin, Angelo."
"PERSON 1: That's it?
PERSON 2: I have no idea."
"PERSON 1: You said ""here's what <u>they</u> want you to do.""  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
PERSON 2: Let's keep it to business, shall we?
PERSON 1: ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
PERSON 2: ...they did it for a lark.
PERSON 1: Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif..."
"PERSON 1: What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
PERSON 2: I want my car.
PERSON 1: You got the money?"
"PERSON 1: What now sir?
PERSON 2: Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
PERSON 1: All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
PERSON 2: Tonight's a good night."
"PERSON 1: Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
PERSON 2: Yup."
"PERSON 1: I...I don't know what I did...
PERSON 2: You lost the charge?
PERSON 1: He was chasing me!"
"PERSON 1: Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
PERSON 2: I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
PERSON 1: That's my girl."
"PERSON 1: Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
PERSON 2: We been had."
"PERSON 1: That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
PERSON 2: He lied to me again."
"PERSON 1: Don't mind what she says, Chris.
PERSON 2: How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
PERSON 1: I'll get some.
PERSON 2: You've said that for weeks.
PERSON 1: I know.
PERSON 2: Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
PERSON 1: Chris!
PERSON 2: All right.  All right.
PERSON 1: I couldn't go near that woman.
PERSON 2: I said all right!"
"PERSON 1: I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
PERSON 2: Am I a doctor, no, but...
PERSON 1: Are you an expert in amnesia?
PERSON 2: Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
PERSON 1: Believed what?
PERSON 2: I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
PERSON 1: So he fooled you.
PERSON 2: If you say so.
PERSON 1: Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
PERSON 2: You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
PERSON 1: You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
PERSON 2: You mean, did I want a date?
PERSON 1: Did you?
PERSON 2: These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
PERSON 1: Some women like Dobermans --
PERSON 2: What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
PERSON 1: See, that's a problem for me, PERSON 2. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from."
"PERSON 1: She's a pro.
PERSON 2: What?"
"PERSON 1: I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
PERSON 2: I know that. I know what's at stake here...
PERSON 1: No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
PERSON 2: About the baby.
PERSON 1: That... and you."
"PERSON 1: Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
PERSON 2: Baltimore?
PERSON 1: The game, Graham.  The Series?"
"PERSON 1: Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
PERSON 2: COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I --
PERSON 2: -- Yes?
PERSON 1: When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?"
"PERSON 1: Start singing.
PERSON 2: I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
PERSON 1: Sing it in pictures, Nick."
"PERSON 1: Where are you going???
PERSON 2: Owh..."
"PERSON 1: Whose side are you on, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
PERSON 1: Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?"
"PERSON 1: For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: We did it.  We did it."
"PERSON 1: What do you mean, she was a hot number.
PERSON 2: If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?"
"PERSON 1: You're staying home.  You're not going out.
PERSON 2: OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?"
"PERSON 1: Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
PERSON 2: How can we reach Phaedos?"
"PERSON 1: You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
PERSON 2: Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -"
"PERSON 1: Hello.
PERSON 2: Beautiful place...
PERSON 1: Sure is."
"PERSON 1: That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
PERSON 2: What's so special about him?
PERSON 1: Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?"
"PERSON 1: Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
PERSON 2: What do you get if you finish?
PERSON 1: Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
PERSON 2: Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
PERSON 1: Like what?
PERSON 2: He gets to be the hero."
"PERSON 1: Me?
PERSON 2: Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty."
"PERSON 1: They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
PERSON 2: Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
PERSON 1: We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
PERSON 2: Lissen, I heard that before--"
"PERSON 1: Lus! Come down here!
PERSON 2: Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!"
"PERSON 1: Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
PERSON 2: Huh!
PERSON 1: My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way."
"PERSON 1: I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
PERSON 2: Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!"
"PERSON 1: You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I swear I did not.
PERSON 1: I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again."
"PERSON 1: Boss!
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: Boss, ain't you going to bed?
PERSON 2: Not right now."
"PERSON 1: Yes.
PERSON 2: You will?
PERSON 1: You better not be fucking teasing me.
PERSON 2: You better not be fuckin' teasin' me."
"PERSON 1: What about her?
PERSON 2: What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding."
"PERSON 1: What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
PERSON 2: Louis, we were French!
PERSON 1: That's different!  What's the matter with you?"
"PERSON 1: Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
PERSON 2: Aw, don't get mushy."
"PERSON 1: ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
PERSON 2: ...Both maybe?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
PERSON 2: I'm always serious.
PERSON 1: Wow!"
"PERSON 1: If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
PERSON 2: I never had sex with you!
PERSON 1: Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2...
PERSON 2: That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy."
"PERSON 1: They were over here, Professor.
PERSON 2: Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?"
"PERSON 1: Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
PERSON 2: Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
PERSON 1: Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
PERSON 2: While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out."
"PERSON 1: Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
PERSON 2: Take me. Let the boy go.
PERSON 1: Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, PERSON 2 -- you're the guest of honor!
PERSON 2: What are you talking about?
PERSON 1: PERSON 2! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today."
"PERSON 1: I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
PERSON 2: Not that I'm in contact with.
PERSON 1: Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
PERSON 2: No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
PERSON 1: It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test."
"PERSON 1: Stu was with me last night.
PERSON 2: Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
PERSON 1: Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
PERSON 2: Working, thank you.
PERSON 1: I thought Blockbuster fired you.
PERSON 2: Twice."
"PERSON 1: You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
PERSON 2: 'Bout time, Pop."
"PERSON 1: And?
PERSON 2: I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world."
"PERSON 1: -- I was just trying to finish some work!
PERSON 2: You mean you've actually begun some?"
"PERSON 1: It's not.
PERSON 2: No."
"PERSON 1: Hello, PERSON 1 here...
PERSON 2: Sal, get 'em in the vault."
"PERSON 1: Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I'm worried about Rose.
PERSON 1: So am I.
PERSON 2: She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
PERSON 1: It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, PERSON 2. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
PERSON 2: Then why does she act so dumb?
PERSON 1: Dumbness doesn't concern her, PERSON 2. And neither does smartness. You see --"
"PERSON 1: Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
PERSON 2: Altitude fifty kilometers...
PERSON 1: Entering the upper ionospere...
PERSON 2: There's a red light on the second intake valve.
PERSON 1: Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark..."
"PERSON 1: Come on!
PERSON 2: His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
PERSON 1: Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev..."
"PERSON 1: Got you.
PERSON 2: Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
PERSON 1: The shower's in there."
"PERSON 1: No. God no.
PERSON 2: Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
PERSON 1: What happened to you?
PERSON 2: His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
PERSON 1: Back from where?
PERSON 2: Just help, will you? Please God, help me --"
"PERSON 1: Money.
PERSON 2: Jack doesn't need money.
PERSON 1: Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
PERSON 2: Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
PERSON 1: Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
PERSON 2: The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
PERSON 1: No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
PERSON 2: You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
PERSON 1: No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
PERSON 2: But not now."
"PERSON 1: Why?
PERSON 2: If I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
"PERSON 1: The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
PERSON 2: Oh."
"PERSON 1: C'mon guys, settle down --
PERSON 2: PERSON 1?
PERSON 1: What?
PERSON 2: How much time do we have?
PERSON 1: Not enough, what do you want?
PERSON 2: I should maybe go to the bathroom.
PERSON 1: Can you hold it?
PERSON 2: I don't know.
PERSON 1: Just hold it, you'll be fine."
"PERSON 1: Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, PERSON 2? What's in it for you?
PERSON 2: It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
PERSON 1: Immune from what?
PERSON 2: You shall see.
PERSON 1: What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat."
"PERSON 1: My reputation precedes me.
PERSON 2: There is no museum in Iskenderun."
"PERSON 1: Hey, just shut up.
PERSON 2: We're gonna die!
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, shut up.
PERSON 2:"
"PERSON 1: I'm working, PERSON 2. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?"
"PERSON 1: What do you want, Vic?
PERSON 2: To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2!
PERSON 2: Mordechai!"
"PERSON 1: Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
PERSON 2: Your wife...?"
"PERSON 1: Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out ""Cloud Nine."" Just like old times.
PERSON 2: Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
PERSON 1: PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
PERSON 2: No man. PE -- ""political education."""
"PERSON 1: Good morning, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Good morning, Mr. PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: Well, PERSON 2, your place or mine?
PERSON 2: You got me all confused.
PERSON 1: A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
PERSON 2: I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman."
"PERSON 1: Is Marsha there?
PERSON 2: Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
PERSON 1: I'll come with you. Let me pack some things."
"PERSON 1: I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
PERSON 2: Can you at least start wearing a bra?"
"PERSON 1: Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
PERSON 2: I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
PERSON 1: Mop rags --!"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, come in.
PERSON 2: What is this? Where's Reed?
PERSON 1: Where do you think? With Sue."
"PERSON 1: What are you doing here?
PERSON 2: I came to visit you.
PERSON 1: Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
PERSON 2: A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
PERSON 1: Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
PERSON 2: Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
PERSON 1: Take a job, PERSON 2. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not."
"PERSON 1: They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
PERSON 2: Planned what?
PERSON 1: An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity."
"PERSON 1: What do you mean?
PERSON 2: I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
PERSON 1: It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light."
"PERSON 1: Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
PERSON 2: My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
PERSON 1: We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion."
"PERSON 1: Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
PERSON 2: I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
PERSON 1: Sir --
PERSON 2: Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, no, no... .
PERSON 2: Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do."
"PERSON 1: Oh, my God.
PERSON 2: Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
PERSON 1: She's devastated.
PERSON 2: Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious."
"PERSON 1: Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
PERSON 2: They sound like you.
PERSON 1: The Nazis did everything the fhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality."
"PERSON 1: Thanks for the great time.
PERSON 2: What is this?
PERSON 1: Long story."
"PERSON 1: Yeah?  How's our new witness?
PERSON 2: D'you find the obstetric nurse?
PERSON 1: She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
PERSON 2: Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her."
"PERSON 1: Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
PERSON 2: He's a virgin."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
PERSON 2: These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, my sister..."
"PERSON 1: It's...42 56 76 .
PERSON 2: 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I can't just leave you!
PERSON 2: You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay."
"PERSON 1: What's with the friggin numbers?
PERSON 2: 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
PERSON 1: I'm an enemy?
PERSON 2: Kinda. Yeah."
"PERSON 1: It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
PERSON 2: Look fella...this is private...
PERSON 1: Nothing's private..."
"PERSON 1: That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
PERSON 2: Zack... He made it... He's alive..."
"PERSON 1: Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
PERSON 2: What post office?
PERSON 1: The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all workPERSON 2 out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interestPERSON 2?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn."
"PERSON 1: This is June twentieth?
PERSON 2: It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ..."
"PERSON 1: Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
PERSON 2: Good night, Daddy."
"PERSON 1: Got it!
PERSON 2: What now?
PERSON 1: Hang on. I have to leave a message."
"PERSON 1: Particularly, Charles.
PERSON 2: What impressed you about him?
PERSON 1: He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
PERSON 2: What kind of person is that?
PERSON 1: Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit."
"PERSON 1: You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
PERSON 2: Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, you scared the shit out of me.
PERSON 2: What are you doing?
PERSON 1: Just thought I'd stop by.
PERSON 2: Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
PERSON 1: Yeah.
PERSON 2: Are you his girlfriend?
PERSON 1: No."
"PERSON 1: Thank God, PERSON 2, we made it.
PERSON 2: Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: It's PERSON 1.
PERSON 2: Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
PERSON 1: Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea."
"PERSON 1: Why are we going here, Jimmy?
PERSON 2: Look on it like a honeymoon."
"PERSON 1: I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
PERSON 2: I hate it too."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, we've only got ten minutes.
PERSON 2: Not now, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: I mean until we start to burn up."
"PERSON 1: It's beautiful. Thank you.
PERSON 2: I hope it brings you luck.
PERSON 1: It will."
"PERSON 1: Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
PERSON 2: Course you didn't.
PERSON 1: But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat."
"PERSON 1: I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
PERSON 2: I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
PERSON 1: An inquiry into what?
PERSON 2: For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
PERSON 1: Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
PERSON 2: Did I say it was a natural death?"
"PERSON 1: Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
PERSON 2: Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
PERSON 1: No problem.  We're in.
PERSON 2: Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island."
"PERSON 1: Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
PERSON 2: They're spooks.
PERSON 1: I don't know what that--
PERSON 2: Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
PERSON 1: I don't know <u>anything</u>.
PERSON 2: No shit.
PERSON 1: What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
PERSON 2: Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
PERSON 1: What if--
PERSON 2: Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even."
"PERSON 1: But what about lunch?
PERSON 2: I'll have it for supper.  So long."
"PERSON 1: He'll kill you.
PERSON 2: You're not hearing me here --
PERSON 1: My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
PERSON 2: He didn't ""find"" Nick's letters, did he.
PERSON 1: Nick, please, it's me --
PERSON 2: You told him about Nick's letters.
PERSON 1: No, Nick, no --
PERSON 2: You're in on this.
PERSON 1: I love you!"
"PERSON 1: ...would you like a drink?
PERSON 2: No thank you.
PERSON 1: Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass."
"PERSON 1: How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
PERSON 2: Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses."
"PERSON 1: Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
PERSON 2: Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?"
"PERSON 1: Thank you, my lady!
PERSON 2: Lady?
PERSON 1: Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child."
"PERSON 1: My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
PERSON 2: That's swell, Missus Fusari.
PERSON 1: You should be ashamed of yourself."
"PERSON 1: It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, PERSON 2?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
PERSON 2: Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see."
"PERSON 1: Now what?
PERSON 2: Jump!"
"PERSON 1: Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
PERSON 2: Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him."
"PERSON 1: Where's my mother?
PERSON 2: I dropped her at home.
PERSON 1: It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?"
"PERSON 1: How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
PERSON 2: It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
PERSON 1: Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
PERSON 2: All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
PERSON 1: The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
PERSON 2: What does that fucking mean?
PERSON 1: That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
PERSON 2: Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your ""end of month board..."" You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
PERSON 1: I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly."
"PERSON 1: Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
PERSON 2: I'm innocent!  Honest, PERSON 1.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
PERSON 1: All right, what happened to me?"
"PERSON 1: You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
PERSON 2: Trust me, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: I'd prefer not to be the PERSON 1 to push the button if I can avoid it.
PERSON 2: The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all."
"PERSON 1: ...What's the expression  me myself and I.
PERSON 2: Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we PERSON 1?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but..."
"PERSON 1: Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
PERSON 2: Listen, ahh - -
PERSON 1: PERSON 1.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1.  Which car were you planning on - -
PERSON 1: Whichever one you are."
"PERSON 1: We!
PERSON 2: I've got the real thing!
PERSON 1: We've got Elvis!"
"PERSON 1: Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
PERSON 2: They must've hit something."
"PERSON 1: It's not what I was expecting.
PERSON 2: What did you think it would be?
PERSON 1: I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam."
"PERSON 1: He's moving his fingers!
PERSON 2: Of course. He saw you moving yours.
PERSON 1: But perhaps he understood --"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I'm concerned.
PERSON 2: About what?
PERSON 1: This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
PERSON 2: Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
PERSON 1: I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
PERSON 2: Oooooo.
PERSON 1: Right in there, pal.
PERSON 2: If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
PERSON 1: That's the old PERSON 2!"
"PERSON 1: Fuck is up?!
PERSON 2: Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, PERSON 1?"
"PERSON 1: Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
PERSON 1: D 'n D?
PERSON 2: Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat."
"PERSON 1: You okay?
PERSON 2: Where do we go from here?
PERSON 1: I don't know, airport I guess.
PERSON 2: They will have our description before we can get a plane.
PERSON 1: Yeah."
"PERSON 1: Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
PERSON 2: Take 'em.
PERSON 1: How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
PERSON 2: Leave the tree."
"PERSON 1: You're in my head...
PERSON 2: Yes.
PERSON 1: Your name is PERSON 2...
PERSON 2: Yes.
PERSON 1: I see..."
"PERSON 1: Easy now.
PERSON 2: Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?"
"PERSON 1: I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
PERSON 2: I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have."
"PERSON 1: HOLD YOUR FIRE!
PERSON 2: Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field."
"PERSON 1: Yeah? What three words, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Pick 'n' Save.
PERSON 1: Hm?
PERSON 2: You heard me, Pick 'n' Save."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
PERSON 2: I am always on time.
PERSON 1: Of course!  Well, we got a big day plannPERSON 1 for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to spePERSON 1 and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
PERSON 2: Uh, PERSON 1die, do you have my money?
PERSON 1: Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Shh.
PERSON 1: I'm gonna go out for a little while.
PERSON 2: When are you gonna be back?
PERSON 1: Not too late.
PERSON 2: Four-thirty in the morning?
PERSON 1: Not too late."
"PERSON 1: When do you have to go back?
PERSON 2: I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
PERSON 1: Then how come you're not with him?
PERSON 2: What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!"
"PERSON 1: You're still not listening! I'm not..
PERSON 2: Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
PERSON 1: This knife is filthy.
PERSON 2: What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
PERSON 1: I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless."
"PERSON 1: Hello, Mrs. Worley.
PERSON 2: How do you do, Mr. Worley?
PERSON 1: Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
PERSON 2: Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
PERSON 1: Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. PERSON 2 Worley.
PERSON 2: Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?"
"PERSON 1: She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
PERSON 2: Your ranch?
PERSON 1: Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually."
"PERSON 1: And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
PERSON 2: As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square."
"PERSON 1: What is this nonsense?
PERSON 2: It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film."
"PERSON 1: Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
PERSON 2: Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
PERSON 1: White supremacist types."
"PERSON 1: We are lost.
PERSON 2: No, it PERSON 1 turn out well.
PERSON 1: How PERSON 1 it?
PERSON 2: I don't know, it's a mystery."
"PERSON 1: Counselor. What can I do for you?
PERSON 2: Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
PERSON 1: Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you."
"PERSON 1: Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
PERSON 2: Phone for you, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: Who is it?
PERSON 2: Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
PERSON 1: Give me that!"
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
PERSON 2: Uh ... PERSON 2 Baker.  This is my brother."
"PERSON 1: You're doing calligraphy?
PERSON 2: I'll write your name.  Just for fun."
"PERSON 1: Reporter?
PERSON 2: Yup!"
"PERSON 1: Uh, yeah.  Is this PERSON 2 SHAPIRO?
PERSON 2: Er, yes.  Speaking.
PERSON 1: ""Speaking""!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!"
"PERSON 1: Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
PERSON 2: No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
PERSON 1: No.
PERSON 2: We're late to get to your mother.
PERSON 1: Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
PERSON 2: Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?"
"PERSON 1: ""Tortious interference""? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
PERSON 2: Lunch?"
"PERSON 1: In English, please.
PERSON 2: Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday."
"PERSON 1: We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
PERSON 2: For what?
PERSON 1: We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
PERSON 2: But I'm just trying to leave."
"PERSON 1: Excuse me?
PERSON 2: I can be quick.  I can even be funny."
"PERSON 1: I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I got nervous. Please....
PERSON 1: Forget it."
"PERSON 1: Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
PERSON 2: I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
PERSON 1: They're practically on us . . .
PERSON 2: That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried."
"PERSON 1: It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
PERSON 2: Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first."
"PERSON 1: Don't bother asking, we already tried.
PERSON 2: It's so very nice to see you again."
"PERSON 1: Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
PERSON 2: About what?
PERSON 1: About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!"
"PERSON 1: You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
PERSON 2: Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
PERSON 1: Is your brother a flyer?
PERSON 2: He was. He died.
PERSON 1: Vietnam?
PERSON 2: Yeah.
PERSON 1: I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
PERSON 2: I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
PERSON 1: We don't have to talk at all."
"PERSON 1: Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
PERSON 2: It'll be tight, but we should make it.
PERSON 1: What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
PERSON 2: I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
PERSON 1: Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again."
"PERSON 1: Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. PERSON 2 and Breeze throw PERSON 2eways glances at each other.
PERSON 2: No!
PERSON 1: I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there."
"PERSON 1: Do you think you could answer that?
PERSON 2: The telephone? It continues to ring.
PERSON 1: Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. PERSON 2 You're not in.
PERSON 1: No.
PERSON 2: All right."
"PERSON 1: The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
PERSON 2: I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage."
"PERSON 1: That's because he doesn't have one.
PERSON 2: Whata you mean?  He told me -
PERSON 1: Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
PERSON 2: What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
PERSON 1: That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme."
"PERSON 1: What's in there?
PERSON 2: POWs.  And their families.
PERSON 1: So I'm supposed to be ...
PERSON 2: Compassionate.  Grateful.
PERSON 1: Proud?
PERSON 2: Sir?
PERSON 1: Of them.
PERSON 2: Yes, yes.
PERSON 1: Fire him."
"PERSON 1: I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
PERSON 2: Go on.
PERSON 1: It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff."
"PERSON 1: Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
PERSON 2: Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
PERSON 1: What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
PERSON 2: Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks."
"PERSON 1: You got her warmed?
PERSON 2: Yeah, she's comin' up."
"PERSON 1: This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
PERSON 2: Queen Bavmorda transformed her."
"PERSON 1: There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
PERSON 2: Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  PERSON 1 Dream on, private."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, what's the matter?
PERSON 2: I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
PERSON 1: No kidding?
PERSON 2: No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
PERSON 1: Where's Matt?
PERSON 2: Matt?
PERSON 1: Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
PERSON 2: The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
PERSON 1: He has?
PERSON 2: Yeah."
"PERSON 1: This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
PERSON 2: Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
PERSON 1: Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
PERSON 2: Goodbye, Bill."
"PERSON 1: I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
PERSON 2: Let me have it."
"PERSON 1: These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
PERSON 2: That's crazy, PERSON 1.  The cops will see us.
PERSON 1: Not if they're looking at something else.
PERSON 2: Like what?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
PERSON 2: All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
PERSON 1: I do know I love you."
"PERSON 1: I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
PERSON 2: Quiet, please. Everyone."
"PERSON 1: Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
PERSON 2: Yes. And I've accepted.
PERSON 1: What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
PERSON 2: I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
PERSON 1: What about your husband?
PERSON 2: I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills."
"PERSON 1: Where were you?
PERSON 2: Bathroom.
PERSON 1: Did you drink and dial?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
PERSON 2: I like it fine here.
PERSON 1: He'll double what I pay you.
PERSON 2: Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
PERSON 1: Sorry."
"PERSON 1: He's not in this building.
PERSON 2: All right, where is he?"
"PERSON 1: Can you drive?
PERSON 2: Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
PERSON 1: It's never too soon to start."
"PERSON 1: Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
PERSON 2: It's possible.  I just don't remember.
PERSON 1: And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
PERSON 2: I... no, I... I just can't...
PERSON 1: It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all."
"PERSON 1: You know Dmitri?
PERSON 2: 'Fraid so."
"PERSON 1: Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
PERSON 2: This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
PERSON 1: It has its moments of uncertainty."
"PERSON 1: We gotta play with more bullets.
PERSON 2: We what?
PERSON 1: We gotta play with more bullets, PERSON 2. It's the only way.
PERSON 2: More bullets in the gun?
PERSON 1: More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
PERSON 2: With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
PERSON 1: PERSON 2... PERSON 2!!! It's the only chance we've got!"
"PERSON 1: The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
PERSON 2: Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
PERSON 1: I'm going to uphold that."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
PERSON 2: Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is."
"PERSON 1: I don't know...
PERSON 2: It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
PERSON 1: All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
PERSON 2: Oh, I appreciate that, PERSON 1 mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... PERSON 1...
PERSON 1: Yes?
PERSON 2: My name is PERSON 2.
PERSON 1: Thank you, PERSON 2."
"PERSON 1: Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
PERSON 2: That's cop bullshit.
PERSON 1: Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
PERSON 2: About what?
PERSON 1: Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
PERSON 2: Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
PERSON 1: You, Kelly, Sam.
PERSON 2: I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now..."
"PERSON 1: Money and nothing else?
PERSON 2: Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
PERSON 1: Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
PERSON 2: No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
PERSON 1: Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
PERSON 2: I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  PERSON 2 - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
PERSON 1: I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS."
"PERSON 1: Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
PERSON 2: You're all hear.
PERSON 1: I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
PERSON 2: Fuck you.
PERSON 1: And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?"
"PERSON 1: SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
PERSON 2: From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user."
"PERSON 1: Good evening, sir.
MR. PERSON 1ANDER: Good evening.
PERSON 1: It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
MR. PERSON 1ANDER: Of course. Food alright?
PERSON 1: Great, sir. Great.
MR. PERSON 1ANDER: Try the wine!
PERSON 1: Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to PERSON 1 that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
PERSON 1: Won't you join me, sir?
MR. PERSON 1ANDER: No, my health doesn't allow it.
PERSON 1: And you, sir?"
"PERSON 1: No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
PERSON 2: A bustier?
PERSON 1: Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
PERSON 2: Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie."
"PERSON 1: So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
PERSON 2: Catherine told me what was in it.
PERSON 1: If she's telling  you the truth.
PERSON 2: Don't you get it, PERSON 1?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
PERSON 1: How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
PERSON 2: He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it."
"PERSON 1: I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
PERSON 2: They sound like finches.
PERSON 1: They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark."
"PERSON 1: THAT is Sid!
PERSON 2: You mean that happy child?"
"PERSON 1: Uh, you first.
PERSON 2: C'mon, PERSON 1, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
PERSON 1: Okay. I'll go right after you."
"PERSON 1: Do you see the maintenance panel?
PERSON 2: Got it.
PERSON 1: Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
PERSON 2: Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
PERSON 1: Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?"
"PERSON 1: She was in here when it went down.
PERSON 2: Can she I.D. them?
PERSON 1: They were wearing masks.
PERSON 2: Of course they were. How many?
PERSON 1: Three."
"PERSON 1: He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
PERSON 2: Even the best make mistakes."
"PERSON 1: And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
PERSON 2: Talk louder. I can't hear you.
PERSON 1: If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
PERSON 2: If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
PERSON 1: And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
PERSON 2: When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, ""PERSON 2, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open,"" so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!"
"PERSON 1: You mean this sign? The one that says ""No Coloreds Allowed."" That's a good question. PERSON 2, how come we missed the sign?
PERSON 2: Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way."
"PERSON 1: Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
PERSON 2: This is still Hong Kong.
PERSON 1: Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
PERSON 2: Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
PERSON 1: No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?"
"PERSON 1: What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
PERSON 2: I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
PERSON 1: Borscht?"
"PERSON 1: Do you mind if I go with you?
PERSON 2: There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
PERSON 1: I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you."
"PERSON 1: Great rehearsal.
PERSON 2: You heard it?
PERSON 1: You're the best one in your row.
PERSON 2: Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
PERSON 1: I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
PERSON 2: I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
PERSON 1: Who's the stiff?
PERSON 2: The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
PERSON 1: Is he dying or something?"
"PERSON 1: Who are you?
PERSON 2: I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out."
"PERSON 1: Scientologist.
PERSON 2: Oh."
"PERSON 1: Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
PERSON 2: 'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
PERSON 1: Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
PERSON 2: Ask your man here."
"PERSON 1: Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
PERSON 2: Is the car out front yours?
PERSON 1: Is this your homework, Larry?
PERSON 2: We know it's his fucking homework, PERSON 1!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?"
"PERSON 1: Good night, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Sleep well."
"PERSON 1: I can see what you looked like as a kid.
PERSON 2: You knew me as a kid.
PERSON 1: Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
PERSON 2: What way?
PERSON 1: After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
PERSON 2: It's nice."
"PERSON 1: Hello.
PERSON 2: Hello."
"PERSON 1: He was only a year and half old.
PERSON 2: What are you doing?
PERSON 1: He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, ""No."" He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2 ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
PERSON 2: Are you joking?
PERSON 1: Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, PERSON 2, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable..."
"PERSON 1: I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
PERSON 2: Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and PERSON 2 wanted to thank you for it.
PERSON 1: I thank you.
PERSON 2: You're welcome."
"PERSON 1: Profile's wrong... there.
PERSON 2: No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
PERSON 1: Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
PERSON 2: Hey, check it."
"PERSON 1: Your Majesty
PERSON 2: There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?"
"PERSON 1: Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
PERSON 2: I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend."
"PERSON 1: Your place or mine?
PERSON 2: Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
PERSON 1: Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?"
"PERSON 1: How did it go with your father last night?
PERSON 2: Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
PERSON 1: I miss him too..."
"PERSON 1: Hello.
PERSON 2: Is this the Cocksucker residence?
PERSON 1: Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
PERSON 2: Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
PERSON 1: You bitch!
PERSON 2: Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
PERSON 1: The police are tracing your call right this minute.
PERSON 2: Well, PERSON 1, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
PERSON 1: FUCK YOU!"
"PERSON 1: What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
PERSON 2: Minus three."
"PERSON 1: Is he all right?  Is he all right?
PERSON 2: He's all doped up.
PERSON 1: I want to talk to him.
PERSON 2: He's groggy, PERSON 1.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back."
"PERSON 1: ...but you're not -- you're not sure...
PERSON 2: We can't wait to be sure.
PERSON 1: I don't want to move again... I like it here.
PERSON 2: Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
PERSON 1: -- where's left to go? --
PERSON 2: -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!"
"PERSON 1: What's your name, boy?
PERSON 2: Walter Livesy.
PERSON 1: Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
PERSON 2: Not so good. You sure you have to?
PERSON 1: I don't know. Wish I did."
"PERSON 1: Sorry about that...
PERSON 2: No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
PERSON 1: Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, I'm not coming down.
PERSON 2: Why?
PERSON 1: I'm too sleepy.
PERSON 2: Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name..."
"PERSON 1: I got something for you to do tomorrow.
PERSON 2: I kind of had plans....
PERSON 1: Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
PERSON 2: Hey, come on....
PERSON 1: No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts."
"PERSON 1: I'm sure they will.
PERSON 2: Good-bye, Mister PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
PERSON 2: What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
PERSON 1: Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
PERSON 2: Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
PERSON 1: Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
PERSON 2: He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
PERSON 1: Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?"
"PERSON 1: How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
PERSON 2: It's a change.
PERSON 1: Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
PERSON 2: Sure.
PERSON 1: Take a seat."
"PERSON 1: More denunciations?
PERSON 2: One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes."
"PERSON 1: Come on!
PERSON 2: No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on."
"PERSON 1: A dirty frame!
PERSON 2: Emma!"
"PERSON 1: I could've sworn I heard something.
PERSON 2: Door's locked. Nothing there."
"PERSON 1: Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
PERSON 2: There's always some PERSON 1pid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
PERSON 1: So what's his reason?
PERSON 2: Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
PERSON 1: She's saving herself for you.
PERSON 2: Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
PERSON 1: I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
PERSON 2: Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
PERSON 1: Which is you...
PERSON 2: So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition."
"PERSON 1: Why don't you read something after the break? PERSON 2 What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
PERSON 1: You used to read.
PERSON 2: Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap."
"PERSON 1: Just barely, sir.
PERSON 2: I'm going down to the station."
"PERSON 1: Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
PERSON 2: We'll be there.
PERSON 1: Goodnight."
"PERSON 1: No!!!
PERSON 2: Stay away, Sam.
PERSON 1: Leave the boy.  Take me."
"PERSON 1: At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
PERSON 2: We don't have 1.2 hours."
"PERSON 1: . . . Superman?. . . . .
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, I really don't see why --
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not."
"PERSON 1: Captain PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
PERSON 1: We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything."
"PERSON 1: What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
PERSON 2: I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
PERSON 1: Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please..."
"PERSON 1: Beach Boy.
PERSON 2: You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
PERSON 1: Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --"
"PERSON 1: I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
PERSON 1: Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
PERSON 2: Okay, PERSON 1, well let's see the way things go from here on."
"PERSON 1: What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
PERSON 2: Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him."
"PERSON 1: You want to share it?
PERSON 2: Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
PERSON 1: Right."
"PERSON 1: You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
PERSON 2: Sure
PERSON 1: Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
PERSON 2: Good luck, PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: ...where is the Back End coming from?
PERSON 2: It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
PERSON 1: The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
PERSON 2: The Hostages...?
PERSON 1: The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
PERSON 2: In the yellow ribbon.
PERSON 1: ...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
PERSON 2: The Ribbon Manufacturers."
"PERSON 1: The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
PERSON 2: I will decide the conclusion.
PERSON 1: You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
PERSON 2: Then cancel my order.
PERSON 1: The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
PERSON 2: There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
PERSON 1: Oh, if there is only time!
PERSON 2: Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
PERSON 1: All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!"
"PERSON 1: Oh my God.
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
PERSON 2: Who?
PERSON 1: Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles."
"PERSON 1: You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
PERSON 2: French Fries and Ketchup."
"PERSON 1: You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
PERSON 2: Come with me, honey."
"PERSON 1: We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
PERSON 2: Really?"
"PERSON 1: Want me to wake her up?
PERSON 2: I'II go....is it...back here?"
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2, what are you doing?
PERSON 2: R-U-S-H Intensely."
"PERSON 1: Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
PERSON 2: He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
PERSON 1: Sure. Right near where my mother works.
PERSON 2: Where is that?
PERSON 1: Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?"
"PERSON 1: Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
PERSON 2: Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
PERSON 1: Apparently.
PERSON 2: Did he ask you to take your clothes off?"
"PERSON 1: I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
PERSON 2: Ben is very ill.
PERSON 1: Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner."
"PERSON 1: He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
PERSON 2: He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out."
"PERSON 1: But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
PERSON 2: But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
PERSON 1: You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
PERSON 2: John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
PERSON 2: What would you have me say, David?
PERSON 1: Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
PERSON 2: Thank you?
PERSON 1: For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you."
"PERSON 1: Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
PERSON 2: Stepmother.
PERSON 1: ... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free."
"PERSON 1: Hey, man.
PERSON 2: Sorry, can you give us a moment?
PERSON 1: No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later."
"PERSON 1: You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
PERSON 2: And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
PERSON 1: You're welcome...??
PERSON 2: For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?"
"PERSON 1: Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
PERSON 2: He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
PERSON 1: Yes, he does."
"PERSON 1: I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
PERSON 2: Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
PERSON 1: And you do it so well."
"PERSON 1: I have followed my feelings.
PERSON 2: You are reckless!"
"PERSON 1: Thank you, Admiral.
PERSON 2: Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
PERSON 1: The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
PERSON 2: Don't be ridiculous.
PERSON 1: I have your word, Mister President?
PERSON 2: Yes, of course."
"PERSON 1: Hey, Frankie.
PERSON 2: How are you?
PERSON 1: Fine, fine."
"PERSON 1: This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
PERSON 2: This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning."
"PERSON 1: Any damage?
PERSON 2: Minimal.
PERSON 1: ""Minimal"" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
PERSON 2: Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
PERSON 1: You are an academic.
PERSON 2: Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
PERSON 1: You think I'm all talk, PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: It doesn't matter what I think.
PERSON 1: Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?"
"PERSON 1: Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, ""Do this, we'll get well..."" Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
PERSON 2: I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth."
"PERSON 1: Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
PERSON 2: Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
PERSON 1: I'm going to get laid."
"PERSON 1: Love...
PERSON 2: Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!"
"PERSON 1: Holy shit...
PERSON 2: Puffy, get over here."
"PERSON 1: John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
PERSON 2: There's some good things on it, though.
PERSON 1: Pardon me?
PERSON 2: The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
PERSON 1: I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media..."
"PERSON 1: Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
PERSON 2: Why do you say that?
PERSON 1: Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
PERSON 2: But the paper ...
PERSON 1: That was set. I'm tellin' you."
"PERSON 1: Put it here.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
PERSON 1: Better keep a lookout."
"PERSON 1: Okay, thanks.
PERSON 2: I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
PERSON 1: That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
PERSON 2: Okay, okay. Bye."
"PERSON 1: When'd you get back?
PERSON 2: Ah. Couple days ago."
"PERSON 1: -- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, PERSON 2... you know better...
PERSON 2: -- oh -- sweetheart...
PERSON 1: -- you shouldn't do me like that...
PERSON 2: -- please, please forgive me...
PERSON 1: -- you know better...
PERSON 2: -- why did you come in today?
PERSON 1: -- left my bag, didn't have no money...
PERSON 2: -- how did you get here?
PERSON 1: -- took a bus.
PERSON 2: -- c'mon, I'll get you home..."
"PERSON 1: Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
PERSON 2: Crime of passion.
PERSON 1: Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
PERSON 2: This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork."
"PERSON 1: They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
PERSON 2: How devilishly clever."
"PERSON 1: Diz, see what you can do.
PERSON 2: I'm on it !"
"PERSON 1: The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
PERSON 2: It's not the backs that worry me.
PERSON 1: What kind of band is this, anyway?
PERSON 2: You got to be under twenty-five -"
"PERSON 1: Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
PERSON 2: I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!"
"PERSON 1: Well, look here!
PERSON 2: Ladies and gentlemen: The ""Straub country-residence""."
"PERSON 1: Sod it, it's broken!
PERSON 2: You haven't switched it on.
PERSON 1: Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished."
"PERSON 1: It's for Ann . . .
PERSON 2: Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
PERSON 1: Flowers.
PERSON 2: I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
PERSON 1: She isn't?
PERSON 2: No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
PERSON 1: Oh!
PERSON 2: Did you want to see her about something important?
PERSON 1: Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the"
"PERSON 1: Only one in town.  Get in, son.
PERSON 2: Ben, when's Delly due back?"
"PERSON 1: You're precious to me, PERSON 2.
PERSON 2: Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley."
"PERSON 1: Let go!
PERSON 2: You set me up.
PERSON 1: I just wanted --
PERSON 2: What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
PERSON 1: No! I just wanted"
"PERSON 1: Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
PERSON 2: Brave... that's right."
"PERSON 1: How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?
PERSON 2: Did you change your hair?
PERSON 1: A little."
"PERSON 1: You--  Standards and Practices?
PERSON 2: PERSON 2 Smythe, yes.
PERSON 1: Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?"
"PERSON 1: Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
PERSON 2: We have new ""guests"" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
PERSON 1: He's been expecting you."
"PERSON 1: Where's Hunt now?
PERSON 2: In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
PERSON 1: And?
PERSON 2: He wants money.
PERSON 1: Pay him.
PERSON 2: Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
PERSON 1: What the hell are you doing, PERSON 2?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him."
"PERSON 1: He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
PERSON 2: It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together."
"PERSON 1: Who sent you?
PERSON 2: Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car."
"PERSON 1: Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
PERSON 2: Since when?
PERSON 1: Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, PERSON 2."
"PERSON 1: Shit!
PERSON 2: PERSON 1! Come with us.
PERSON 1: Go!
PERSON 2: PERSON 1!
PERSON 1: Get up there PERSON 2!"
"PERSON 1: You still should've moved.
PERSON 2: I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot."
"PERSON 1: I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
PERSON 2: You will?
PERSON 1: Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!"
"PERSON 1: Jennifer?
PERSON 2: No it's mom.
PERSON 1: Mom!"
"PERSON 1: What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
PERSON 2: Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now...."
"PERSON 1: I warned you.
PERSON 2: Go to hell."
"PERSON 1: Oh, this is all right, PERSON 2. I just wanted to be sure.
PERSON 2: Say, I want to be sure, too!"
"PERSON 1: They shouldn't let people like you into space.
PERSON 2: Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
PERSON 1: Listen --
PERSON 2: We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him."
"PERSON 1: Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
PERSON 2: Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
PERSON 1: He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money."
"PERSON 1: Hey?
PERSON 2: H'm?
PERSON 1: I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
PERSON 2: That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
PERSON 1: Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
PERSON 2: Yeah?
PERSON 1: big subject with me, yeah.
PERSON 2: Yeah?"
"PERSON 1: Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
PERSON 2: We're using-
PERSON 1: You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
PERSON 2: Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
PERSON 1: A delicious amalgamation, is it?"
"PERSON 1: I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
PERSON 2: Me too..."
"PERSON 1: I'm lost.  Goodbye.
PERSON 2: No!"
"PERSON 1: We already know. All about it.
PERSON 2: It was on the television."
"PERSON 1: I thought that was it.
PERSON 2: So he's in the next one, PERSON 1. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!"
"PERSON 1: ...Jesus!
PERSON 2: Least we'd already be at the Morgue."
"PERSON 1: Sort of.
PERSON 2: Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it..."
"PERSON 1: Will you shut-up!!!
PERSON 2: You're a true <u>friend</u>.
PERSON 1: I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
PERSON 2: You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
PERSON 1: I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
PERSON 2: That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
PERSON 1: I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
PERSON 2: So what? You going to help me?
PERSON 1: WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PERSON 2 the Grail, the voices...                           PERSON 1... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        PERSON 1... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?..."
"PERSON 1: Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
PERSON 2: Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
PERSON 1: Oh."
"PERSON 1: No You mean...?
PERSON 2: Uh-huh.
PERSON 1: The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
PERSON 2: That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai."
"PERSON 1: It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
PERSON 2: Stop acting like a silly little fag!"
"PERSON 1: We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
PERSON 2: Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!"
"PERSON 1: How?
PERSON 2: What?"
"PERSON 1: I've lost interest.
PERSON 2: He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me..."
"PERSON 1: So what are you gonna do?
PERSON 2: I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
PERSON 1: Why?
PERSON 2: A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the ""Clips.""  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
PERSON 1: What's Mom think?
PERSON 2: We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days..."
"PERSON 1: Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
PERSON 2: Sam...  Thank you."
"PERSON 1: Could be.
PERSON 2: Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards."
"PERSON 1: Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
PERSON 2: Where?
PERSON 1: Half-five. At Millie's."
"PERSON 1: We're building up tourism, PERSON 2--
PERSON 2: People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
PERSON 1: PERSON 2--
PERSON 2: You ought to put up a banner-- ""Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy""--"
"PERSON 1: Yes?
PERSON 2: Puffed cheese?
PERSON 1: No thank you.
PERSON 2: I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
PERSON 1: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
PERSON 2: No.
PERSON 1: Then let's assume I don't.
PERSON 2: Yes sir."
"PERSON 1: This story is big huh?
PERSON 2: Mammoth.
PERSON 1: The Gazette's small huh?"
"PERSON 1: Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
PERSON 2: Why?
PERSON 1: So they can have their hamburgers!"
"PERSON 1: That wasn't her toe.
PERSON 2: Whose toe was it, PERSON 1?
PERSON 1: How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
PERSON 2: The nail polish, PERSON 1.
PERSON 1: Fine, PERSON 2.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
PERSON 2: Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
PERSON 1: You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, PERSON 2.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
PERSON 2: But PERSON 1--
PERSON 1: I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
PERSON 2: They're gonna kill her, PERSON 1, and then they're gonna kill me--
PERSON 1: Well that's just, that's the stress talking, PERSON 2.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
PERSON 2: What about the toe?
PERSON 1: FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!"
"PERSON 1: Why don't you just go now, okay?
PERSON 2: I told you I'm not easily shocked.
PERSON 1: You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
PERSON 2: What?
PERSON 1: Get your kicks somewhere else.
PERSON 2: Hey, I'm not --
PERSON 1: Depraved? My mistake.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1."
"PERSON 1: Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
PERSON 2: I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
PERSON 1: Verdell?"
"PERSON 1: Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
PERSON 2: Jos, that's not what we're --
PERSON 1: PERSON 2, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?"
"PERSON 1: Where'd this come from?
PERSON 2: The library.
PERSON 1: We have a library?
PERSON 2: A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  PERSON 1, come here, look at this.
PERSON 1: No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish."
"PERSON 1: I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
PERSON 2: Thanks for reminding me.
PERSON 1: I guess we get what we pay for, huh?"
"PERSON 1: Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
PERSON 2: Look PERSON 1, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
PERSON 1: You're all scumbags."
"PERSON 1: PERSON 2dy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
PERSON 2: SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course."
"PERSON 1: You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
PERSON 2: That's right... and we might as well face it."
"PERSON 1: Yes, you asshole.
PERSON 2: About what?
PERSON 1: About things that are important to me.
PERSON 2: Like what?
PERSON 1: Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial..."
"PERSON 1: Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
PERSON 2: Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here."
"PERSON 1: We're quite a pair, you and I.
PERSON 2: Mad. for each other."
"PERSON 1: He made that. In his off hours.
PERSON 2: It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
PERSON 1: Didn't you know he made things?"
"PERSON 1: John!
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?"
"PERSON 1: I believed in you...
PERSON 2: Give me absolution."
"PERSON 1: This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
PERSON 2: They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
PERSON 1: Figures...
PERSON 2: They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them."
"PERSON 1: Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
PERSON 2: Of course!  That's what negotiations are for."
"PERSON 1: Where are you,...PERSON 2?
PERSON 2: You're not gonna believe this...
PERSON 1: Try me.
PERSON 2: I'm...inside you."
"PERSON 1: That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
PERSON 2: I insist, it is the least we can do."
"PERSON 1: Drink?
PERSON 2: I need to talk to you alone."
"PERSON 1: I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
PERSON 2: PERSON 1, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
PERSON 1: Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
PERSON 2: You want the title shot?
PERSON 1: Say what you're gonna say.
PERSON 2: You want the title shot or not?
PERSON 1: Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
PERSON 2: This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?"
"PERSON 1: What is this place?
PERSON 2: This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years."
"PERSON 1: I don't know. I only saw one.
PERSON 2: I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
PERSON 1: What should I do?
PERSON 2: Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do."
"PERSON 1: What's so funny?
PERSON 2: Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life."
"PERSON 1: Sorry, my brother.
PERSON 2: Since we was just grasshoppers...
PERSON 1: You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world."
"PERSON 1: Oh my God.  Are you serious?
PERSON 2: I think so...What do you think?
PERSON 1: I think so too..."
"PERSON 1: Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. PERSON 2. Go get your bonnet on.
PERSON 2: Yes, sir!"
"PERSON 1: What happened?
PERSON 2: York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary."
"PERSON 1: YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
PERSON 2: NO JOKE, PERSON 1. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
PERSON 1: I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT."
"PERSON 1: Minimal.
PERSON 2: We made it?"
